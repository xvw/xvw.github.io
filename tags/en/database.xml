      This article is a reinterpretation of an [article](https://github.com/xvw/planet/blob/master/content/posts/notion-cafe.org) I wrote in 2021 on my [former site](https://github.com/xvw/planet). I tried to focus on the essentials, and it outlines the set of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/about) pages I created to index my coffee consumption and attempt to build an intuition about understanding my tastes.
In general, I think that building a _knowledge base_ is a good practice when trying to explore a discipline. Being far from an expert in both coffee and Notion, it’s likely that much of what I describe in this article may seem naïve! To sum up, this article will present how I set up an infrastructure to index the coffees I taste, with the goal of providing precise metrics to help characterize my preferences, using the Notion tool, while also sharing some techniques and tricks I learned during the creation of this system.
