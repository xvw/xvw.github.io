</section><article class="synopsis"><p>This article is a reinterpretation of an <a href="https://github.com/xvw/planet/blob/master/content/posts/notion-cafe.org">article</a> I wrote in 2021 on my <a href="https://github.com/xvw/planet">former site</a>. I tried to focus on the essentials, and it outlines the set of <a href="https://www.notion.so/about">Notion</a> pages I created to index my coffee consumption and attempt to build an intuition about understanding my tastes.
In general, I think that building a <em>knowledge base</em> is a good practice when trying to explore a discipline. Being far from an expert in both coffee and Notion, it’s likely that much of what I describe in this article may seem naïve! To sum up, this article will present how I set up an infrastructure to index the coffees I taste, with the goal of providing precise metrics to help characterize my preferences, using the Notion tool, while also sharing some techniques and tricks I learned during the creation of this system.</p>

world of <strong>specialty coffee</strong>, we tend to simply accept a cup without
<em>really</em> caring about the characteristics of what we’ll be
drinking. Yet, there are <strong>many</strong> factors that influence the cup: the
origin of the beans, the coffee variety, the drying method, the roast
profile, the extraction method, and many others. Much like wine,
<em>understanding what one tastes</em> is essential to appreciate specialty
coffee and to develop interest in the product — to understand how to
choose one’s coffee and how to prepare it properly, while potentially
reducing the number of steps needed to approach, based on these
characteristics, the ideal cup.</p>
<p>In this article, I will present <strong>my use of Notion</strong> for building a
record of my coffee preparations (a database), allowing me to
<em>understand how I appreciate coffee</em> and to be able to define, based
on the extraction methods, a recipe suited to attempt to brew cups
that match <em>my preferences</em> and, potentially, to adapt to my guests’
expectations!</p>
<p>However, this article is neither a general <em>guide to using Notion</em> nor
an introduction to specialty coffee, it is a report on how I decided
to organize my coffee indexing in order to collect metrics about my
preferences.</p>
<h2 id="about-notion"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#about-notion"></a>About Notion</h2>
<p>It’s very difficult to summarize Notion without using the neologism
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id%C3%A9ateur_%28informatique%29"><em>ideator</em></a>. In
general, when I try to describe it to people around me, I present it
as a note-taking tool <em>on steroids</em>, allowing the manipulation, among
other things, of <em>spreadsheets</em> as first-class values. Over the past
few years, this kind of advanced note-taking tool has become very
popular, and their versatility places them within the
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9veloppement_No_code"><em>NoCode/LowCode</em></a>
movement. There are many of them, and to my knowledge, the most
popular ones (specifically as extensions of note-taking tools) are
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://anytype.io/">AnyType</a>,
<a href="https://evernote.com/fr-fr">Evernote</a>, and Notion. I don’t have
strong opinions about which tool to favor — although, for ideological
reasons, I should probably spend more time playing with AnyType, which
has the great advantage of being <strong>free</strong> and <em>local-first</em>. Moreover,
much of what I’ll present in this article could work perfectly well
with a <em>more specific</em> piece of software, such as
<a href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, or even with a traditional
relational database. But when I began indexing my coffee consumption,
I wanted a generic tool to handle <strong>all</strong> of my digital note-taking.</p>
<p>Additionally, at the time I wrote the first version of this article,
<a href="https://www.shubham-sharma.fr/">Shubham Sharma</a> was talking a lot
about Notion on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKx4-_XO5sR0AO0j8ye7zQ">YouTube
channel</a> and
offered a <a href="https://www.notionfacile.fr/">free course</a> to get started
with the tool! Moreover, at that time, I was working at <a href="https://memo.bank/">Memo
Bank</a>, and one of my colleagues, <a href="https://jonathanlefevre.com/">Jonathan
Lefèvre</a>, also had plenty of feedback
about Notion and, upon rereading the first version, did me the honor
of saying (roughly_ in these terms):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always amusing and interesting to see a programmer use Notion,
and you too have found a very particular — and slightly unsettling —
use for it, at least for the uninitiated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, I don’t know if Notion is the most suitable tool, and I
don’t know if I’ve used it in the most relevant way (<em>since my goal
wasn’t to drastically increase my productivity</em>), but after 2 years of
use, I’m quite satisfied with how much my <strong>understanding of my
tastes</strong> in coffee has improved!</p>
<h3 id="on-nocodelowcode"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#on-nocodelowcode"></a>On NoCode/LowCode</h3>
<p>I love reinventing the wheel, so it might seem strange that I decided
to use proprietary software when I could simply <em>reimplement</em> an
entire suite of coffee-dedicated tools! Especially since, in a shared
discussion space I used to frequent a lot in 2020, <em>NoCode</em> (back when
the term <em>LowCode</em> was still quite obscure) had a very bad reputation.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am very supportive of <em>NoCode/LowCode</em> in the sense
that they allow me to focus on <strong>the problem I want to address</strong>, and
even though I am convinced that to use such tools <em>very effectively</em>,
it’s better to be familiar with programming (which requires a certain
form of logic and modeling skills), my only <em>real</em> criticism of this
collection of tools is their name. Indeed, you are always programming,
and using a tool <em>called &quot;NoCode&quot;</em> does not exempt you from needing an
architect capable of building a relevant solution.</p>
<p>From my point of view, using Notion and the like allows me to have
form generation <em>for free</em>, and therefore to focus on <strong>data
processing</strong> rather than data entry, which, in many cases, is a
monumental time saver.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, 2026 will likely be the year I
seriously look into <a href="https://anytype.io">AnyType</a> to favor a <strong>free</strong>
and <em><strong>local-first</strong></em> software, because not having to write every line
of code, character by character, seems far less problematic
<em>ideologically speaking</em> than having to rely on proprietary
technologies, over which I have no governance of my own data.</p>
<h3 id="workspace-organization"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workspace-organization"></a>Workspace Organization</h3>
<p>Notion allows you to structure hierarchical documents — documents can
contain other documents. Each of these documents is a collection of
blocks whose behavior varies depending on the need. There are title
blocks, paragraphs, images, but they can also reference other
documents, document fragments, or even <em>views</em> configured from data
sources. The versatility of blocks allows you to neatly organize your
workspace.</p>
<p>Since a Notion workspace isn’t limited to a single use, I organized
all my pages dedicated to coffee indexing into one document, simply
called <code>Coffee</code> (to which I added the <em>emoji</em> <code>:coffee:</code> because I’m
modern and I use <em>emojis</em>). This first document serves as an umbrella;
you can think of it as a <em>namespace</em> or a <em>directory</em>. Within this
same document, I add a new <code>database</code> document (associated with the
icon <code>:floppy_disk:</code>) where I will place all my tables. Then, I can
build views (which consume these tables), also within the <code>Coffee</code>
document, to address specific needs. Compartmentalizing <strong>raw data</strong>
is probably a developer’s quirk, but I’m happy with it.</p>
<h4 id="on-databases"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#on-databases"></a>On Databases</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/help/intro-to-databases">Notion databases</a> are
probably one of the most useful features (from my point of view). They
allow you to define tables in the same sense as relational databases,
with the possibility of including fields that are formulas whose
values depend on other fields. This is partly why I consider Notion
databases to sit at the intersection of a table and a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Since there are so many features attached to databases, I will try to
explain, throughout the article, the different functions I use (when
there might be potential ambiguities).</p>
<h2 id="initial-features"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initial-features"></a>Initial Features</h2>
<p>Now that we have <em>briefly</em> gone over some Notion features, we can turn
our attention to coffee, <em>properly speaking</em>. Our exercise will be to
try to understand the coffee lifecycle, <strong>from tree to cup</strong>, in order
to extract elements that <strong>will serve in modeling our
system</strong>. Through this modeling, we can describe a collection of
tables that will then be used to create views to answer factual
questions. From my point of view, this is the most fun part, and I am
firmly convinced that, whether you use <em>NoCode/LowCode</em> or fully
program the application <em>from scratch</em>, the approach is the same (and
fundamental).</p>
<h3 id="from-tree-to-cup"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#from-tree-to-cup"></a>From Tree to Cup</h3>
<p>To derive relevant models for our indexing, it is important to
understand the coffee lifecycle. Indeed, by observing the different
stages from the tree to the coffee beans used for brewing, we can
isolate a collection of criteria that will influence the <em>cup</em>. Not
being (yet, I hope) an expert, it is likely that my understanding of
the cycle is naive and clumsy, so I am open to any suggestions for
improvement!</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the coffee trade involves several parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>producers, who own coffee farms and handle the drying of the beans;</li>
<li>exporters, who transport the beans to roasters;</li>
<li>roasters, who roast the beans;</li>
<li>merchants, who supply retailers and <em>coffee shops</em>;</li>
<li>preparers (<em>baristas</em> or the <em>end consumer</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is obvious that these different parties do not always form
completely separate groups. It is very common for a roaster to also be
a merchant (or even a <em>barista</em>). But this <em>breakdown</em> of the various
parties involved allows us to describe a rough schematic of the coffee
journey, <em>from tree to cup</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-to-cup-en.svg" alt="From Tree To Cup" ></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Harvesting</strong>:<br>
This stage highlights several criteria. First, the
<strong>geographical region</strong> where the coffee was harvested, and by
extension, the <strong>producer</strong> (or farm) and the altitude of the
plantation, the <strong>type of tree</strong> (naively, <strong>Robusta</strong> versus
<strong>Arabica</strong>, although in specialty coffee, you almost exclusively
find Arabica), the <strong>coffee variety</strong>, and information related to
harvest dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drying</strong>:<br>
As consumers, we are used to seeing only coffee beans (or ground),
but <strong>the coffee bean is the heart of a cherry</strong>. There are several
drying techniques — <em>natural</em>, <em>washed</em>, or <em>honey</em> (which has
several specific variations) — that <strong>strongly influence</strong> the
taste in the cup. This <strong>process</strong> is an essential criterion. I
plan to write an article entirely dedicated to explaining the
different drying processes.  In addition to drying, some producers
add a step of <strong>additional fermentation</strong> (which can be, for
example, <em>anaerobic</em> or <em>carbonic</em>), which also greatly affects the
coffee’s aromas. Given ecological conditions, coffee has become a
luxury product, making import costly, which leads some producers to
experiment with <strong>aromatic alterations</strong> during fermentation,
further influencing the cup’s flavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roasting</strong>:<br>
Roasting, roughly the <em>cooking</em> of green beans to reveal their
aromas, plays a crucial role (obviously) in the final cup. In
France, it is generally the roaster who chooses the producers and
farms they want to work with, allowing us to extract new criteria:
the <strong>roaster</strong>, the <strong>roast level</strong>, the <strong>aromatic profile</strong> of
the coffee, and the <strong>roasting date</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brewing</strong>:<br>
The way coffee is brewed also strongly affects the final cup and is
determined by several criteria: the <strong>recipe used</strong>, the <strong>amount
of coffee</strong>, the <strong>amount of water</strong>, the <strong>grind size</strong>, the
<strong>water temperature</strong>, the <strong>freshness of the coffee</strong>, the
<strong>extraction time</strong>, in short, all the variables of the
recipe. This allows us to speculate that the overall appreciation
of a coffee is <strong>recipe-dependent for a specific <em>roast batch</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a fairly broad (and, for now, vague) view of the different
criteria we will use to describe our modeling. Rest assured, when we
explicitly build the tables and views, I will make sure to revisit the
different criteria used.</p>
<p>Attentive readers will notice that I haven’t mentioned the export
process at all. To be completely honest, I have no idea how it works,
and I’m not convinced it’s possible (consistently) to track criteria
related to export. That’s why I discreetly allow myself not to worry
about it. Additionally, the <strong>freshness</strong> of the beans used during
brewing also affects the cup; storage conditions — type of container,
exposure to light, etc. — should ideally be an indexing
criterion. However, since I use a fairly consistent storage method
(applied to all my coffees), I haven’t found it relevant to highlight
in my indexing!</p>
<h3 id="note-on-replicability"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#note-on-replicability"></a>Note on replicability</h3>
<p>In the outline of the criteria we’ve selected, the recipe plays a very
important role. For indexing to be meaningful, it’s essential to be
able to reproduce a recipe precisely and collect as many metrics as
possible. Moreover, imagine savoring the most delicious cup you’ve
ever made — it would be terrible not to be able to reproduce it due to
measurement inaccuracies! For this, I use a collection of precise
tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A click grinder, the <a href="https://www.comandantegrinder.com/">Comandante
C40</a>. A click grinder allows
precise control over the <em>grind size</em>, and the Comandante is a very
versatile grinder whose click settings have become almost a
<em>standard</em> for adjustment. The grinder is truly an essential tool,
as coffee loses a large part of its aromas 15 minutes after
grinding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A scale, the <a href="https://brewista.co/products/smart-scale-2">Brewista Smart Scale
2</a>, precise and equipped
with a timer, which I use to weigh the coffee and water. (This helps
me avoid volumetric measurements, which are often imprecise and
difficult to replicate.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A kettle with precise temperature control (allowing degree-by-degree
adjustments) and ideally a gooseneck spout (for pour-over coffee). I
use the <a href="https://brewista.co/products/artisan-electric-gooseneck-kettle">Artisan Electric Gooseneck
Kettle</a>,
also from <a href="https://brewista.co/">Brewista</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="table-modelling"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#table-modelling"></a>Table modelling</h2>
<p>Even though normally one wouldn’t start by building <em>user stories</em> to
derive a relevant model, since a Notion workspace is easier to evolve
than a database used in production, and the somewhat naive mapping of
the coffee lifecycle gives us intuitions about which variables we’d
like to track, I allow myself to build tables that will help describe
the data I want to exploit in specific views. We can therefore
populate our <code>database</code> document with tables. All of these tables are
organized by theme, but I think for the purposes of this article, it
isn’t necessary to document this organization (which is somewhat a
matter of personal preference).</p>
<h3 id="describing-farmsproducers-and-roasters"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-farmsproducers-and-roasters"></a>Describing farms/producers and roasters</h3>
<p>Even though I became interested in farms and producers relatively
late, by tasting more and more coffee, I have learned to <em>identify</em>
farms whose harvests I consistently enjoy (for example, the
extraordinary <a href="https://www.panamavarietals.com/copy-of-cafe-gallardo">Finca
Hartmann</a> from
Panama). So before describing a farm briefly, it is important to be
able to locate it geographically.</p>
<h4 id="a-first-set-of-tables-geographical-areas"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-first-set-of-tables-geographical-areas"></a>A first set of tables: geographical areas</h4>
<p>Let’s tackle our first modeling exercise, where we will face the
construction of <strong>relationships between tables</strong>! My model is fairly
simple: I distinguish 4 tables — Continent, Country, Region, and
City. These 4 levels provide sufficient granularity (even though the
terminology is not uniform across all countries; for example, in
Panama, one would refer to a
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corregimiento"><em>corregimiento</em></a> rather
than a region).</p>
<p>I don’t need information other than the name (which serves as the
index) and a relational hierarchy following this order: <code>cities -&gt; regions -&gt; countries -&gt; continents</code>. Here is a schematic view of the
geographic model (which I placed in a document named <code>Location</code>):</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-geopoint.svg" alt="Geopoint" ></p>
<p>You’ll notice that I added <em>dashed</em> relations (labeled <code>rollup</code>). In Notion, there are two types of relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Standard</em> relations, which reference another table directly;</li>
<li><em>Rollups</em>, which describe a <strong>relation field</strong>. This is very similar
to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_%28object-oriented_programming%29"><em>Delegates</em></a>
in object-oriented programming. In other words, <strong>a Rollup is a
virtual field computed from a relation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rollups</em> allow adding context to a table and <strong>should not be filled
manually</strong>. For example, once I name a region and assign it a country,
the continent field is automatically computed. However, there is a
small restriction with <em>Rollups</em>: <strong>you cannot create a Rollup that
takes another Rollup as its source</strong>. Rollups always take <strong>relations
as their source</strong>. In the modeling schema, you can see that in
<code>cities</code>, I list both the country and the continent it belongs
to. According to the rule about Rollups of Rollups, this should be
impossible. But there’s a trick!</p>
<h5 id="the-mirror-field-technique"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-mirror-field-technique"></a>The <em>Mirror Field</em> Technique</h5>
<p>In our example, we have the tables <code>continents</code>, <code>countries</code>,
<code>regions</code>, and <code>cities</code>. For readability, I want:</p>
<ul>
<li>entries in <code>countries</code> to list their associated <code>continent</code>;</li>
<li>entries in <code>regions</code> to list their <code>country</code> and, transitively,
their associated <code>continent</code>;</li>
<li>entries in <code>cities</code> to list their <code>region</code>, and transitively their
<code>country</code> and <code>continent</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relations</strong> allow referencing an entry directly;</li>
<li><strong>Rollups</strong> allow targeting a field of a reference (transitively).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a <strong>Rollup</strong> always uses a relation as its source, it is not
possible, in the case of <code>cities</code>, to pull up the continent — this is
actually the only table where the problem arises. <code>country</code> can use
only one relation to express its continent, <code>region</code> uses a relation
to express its <code>country</code> and a Rollup to bring up the continent, and
in the case of <code>cities</code>, a relation expresses the <code>region</code>, a Rollup
brings up the <code>country</code>, but we cannot directly bring up the
continent.</p>
<p>To allow <code>cities</code> to access the continent from <code>regions</code>, it is enough
to use a <strong>mirror field</strong>, which I called <code>_mirror_continent</code>. This
will be a formula equal to <code>prop(&quot;Continent&quot;)</code>. This creates a second
field that is strictly equivalent to the <code>Continent</code> field, except
that this field is not the result of a Rollup (even though <code>Continent</code>
itself is). It then becomes possible to reference this field from
<code>cities</code> by creating another Rollup pointing to the region and
referencing our new <code>_mirror_continent</code> field, which is not the result
of a Rollup computation, making the continent a city belongs to
explicit.</p>
<p>For enthusiasts of <strong>encapsulation</strong>, Notion makes it easy to hide
fields from the main view, keeping our <code>regions</code> view easy to read. In
the rest of the article, I won’t specifically distinguish between
using a mirror field or a Rollup, as the former is just a technical
detail necessary to work around an inherent Rollup limitation.</p>
<h4 id="describing-farms"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-farms"></a>Describing farms</h4>
<p>Now that we can <em>locate</em> a farm, we can describe them. The exercise
isn’t very complicated. Indeed, I simply list the fields that allow me
to build a <em>directory</em> of farms:</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-farm.svg" alt="Farms modelling" ></p>
<p>I need a <strong>name</strong> and a <strong>website</strong> (or social page) and to reference
the <strong>city</strong> where the farm is located. More generally, I find it
useful to have quick access to the country, which is why there is a
Rollup (requiring the addition of a <strong>mirror field</strong> on <code>country</code> in
<code>cities</code>). Now, we can describe the roasters.</p>
<h4 id="describing-roasters"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-roasters"></a>Describing roasters</h4>
<p>Describing roasters isn’t fundamentally different from describing
farms. You’ll find common fields — <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>City</strong>, a Rollup from
the city to the <strong>Country</strong>, and a <strong>URL</strong>. I added a precise address
(mainly to reference a <em>street</em>), as it’s more common that I want to
visit a roaster’s shop rather than the producer’s farm, and two
boolean fields to indicate <strong>if I have already tried their coffee</strong>
and whether the <strong>roaster is still active</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-roaster.svg" alt="Roasters modelling" ></p>
<p>Keeping inactive roasters allows me to maintain consistent
indexing. Having a marker indicating whether a coffee from a roaster
has already been tasted/tested enables the creation of a first
tool. However, once our model is richer, it will be possible to
automate the computation of this field.</p>
<h5 id="a-first-tool-coffee-roasters-to-try"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-first-tool-coffee-roasters-to-try"></a>A first tool: coffee roasters to try</h5>
<p>One of Notion’s strengths is that it allows you <strong>to build data
prisms</strong>, that is, <strong>views that apply filters and sorting methods</strong> to
existing databases. This makes it easy to create a view that lists all
the roasters I haven’t tried yet.</p>
<p>For example, using this <code>roasters</code> table (with a very small dataset),
we would want a view called <code>Roasters to Try</code> to display only <em>L'Arbre
à Café</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-notion-roasters.png" alt="Roasters Lists" ></p>
<p>To do this, simply create a view (with the <strong>List</strong> <em>layout</em>) and add
an <a href="https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-advanced-database-filters"><strong>advanced
filter</strong></a>
specifying that the <code>Tested</code> field should not be checked and the
<code>Active</code> field should be checked. In my view, building advanced
filters is quite intuitive:</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-notion-roaster-filter.png" alt="Filter Application" ></p>
<p>Which, logically, produces a view showing only <strong>active</strong> and
<strong>untested</strong> roasters.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-notion-roasters-view.png" alt="Filter Application Result" ></p>
<p>It’s partly for this kind of <em>possibility</em> that I decided to use
Notion at the time. There are several view templates (for example, one
that displays data as a <em>Kanban</em> table), and combined with sorting and
filtering, it is possible to create specific views (which can be
embedded in other documents) to answer very precise questions. Later
in the article, we will illustrate other uses of these views.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-coffee-varieties-and-beans"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#modeling-coffee-varieties-and-beans"></a>Modeling Coffee, Varieties, and Beans</h3>
<p>We can move on to what I consider the most fun part: <strong>describing the
coffee</strong>! Even though there are <strong>over 130 species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea">coffee
plants</a></strong>, we generally
distinguish two main ones used for making coffee:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica">Arabica</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora">Canephora</a> — commonly
called <strong>Robusta</strong>. In specialty coffee, you will almost exclusively
find <em>Arabica</em>, which is harder to cultivate but produces
higher-quality coffee. Next, there is a very large collection of
coffee varieties derived from Robusta and Arabica, called <em>Cultivars</em>
(or cultivated varieties). In the following sections, we will model
the tables describing coffee varieties and then describe roasted
beans.</p>
<h4 id="describing-the-different-varieties-of-coffee"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-the-different-varieties-of-coffee"></a>Describing the different varieties of coffee</h4>
<p>A first <em>design</em> question arises quite directly. Although we know that
generally there will be a distinction between Arabica and Robusta,
should we dedicate a table to describe the coffee plants, or can we
just consider it a compact field — for example, <code>is_arabica</code>, a
boolean where <code>false</code> would imply the plant is Robusta? I don’t have a
strong opinion on the best approach, so I will dedicate a specific
table. This allows me to use the page attached to an entry — in
Notion, it’s possible to add additional content to each table entry —
to collect notes related to the coffee plants. We can therefore
describe the varieties in this way:</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-cultivar.svg" alt="Cultivar Modelling" ></p>
<p>The species (<code>species</code>) aren’t very original; I just store the <strong>short
name</strong> and the <strong>full name</strong>. Then, for the <em>cultivars</em>, I store a
<strong>name</strong>, a <strong>link</strong> (usually pointing to the excellent <a href="https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/">World Coffee
Research</a> index), a list of
<strong>alternative names</strong> (for example, the <em>Villa Sarchi</em> variety is also
called <em>Villalobos</em>), a <strong>species</strong> (<em>Arabica</em> or <em>Robusta</em>), and
potential <strong>parent cultivars</strong>.</p>
<p>Referencing parent cultivars allows us to capture artificial or
natural genetic mutations. For example, <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2023/10/pink-bourbon-specialty-coffee/">Bourbon
Rose</a>
is a natural mutation of
<a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/bourbon">Bourbon</a>
(one of the most popular cultivars), and <a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/mundo-novo">Mundo
Novo</a>
is an artificial mutation of
<a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/typica">Typica</a>
(probably the oldest variety) and
<a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/bourbon">Bourbon</a>. This
level of detail might seem like a nicety, but I find that having an
approximate idea of a cultivar’s lineage provides a better
understanding of its characteristics.</p>
<p>Now, we have all the tables needed to describe <strong>roasted beans</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="describing-the-roasted-beans"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-the-roasted-beans"></a>Describing the roasted beans</h4>
<p>We now have all the ingredients to describe the bean we will use to
make a cup. This will naturally be one of the most complex tables in
our system. Logically, it will include <strong>producers</strong> (farms) and
<strong>roasters</strong>, the <strong>regions</strong> (one might think that the producer alone
would suffice to describe the region, but I’m not sure all farms are
entirely contained within a single region, and some beans may result
from collaboration between two farms, where one provides the cherries
and the other handles fermentation, hence my need to duplicate the
region), the list of <strong>varieties</strong> (when a coffee consists of a single
variety, it is called a single origin; when it contains multiple
varieties, it is called a <em>blend</em>), and other fields that I will
describe after presenting the structure (to avoid overloading the
diagram, I’ve taken the liberty of not reproducing the relation
tables):</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-bean.svg" alt="Beans Modellisation" ></p>
<p>This is the model that, in retrospect, required the most thought and
still has some shortcomings. The fields <code>Cultivars</code>, <code>Farms</code>,
<code>Roasters</code>, and <code>Regions</code> accept <strong>multiple</strong> relations to account for
<em>collaborations</em> and potentially <em>blends</em>.</p>
<p>The process is described by the <code>Process</code> field, which allows
selection from a list of drying methods. This list can obviously
evolve over time, although after several years of tasting coffee, it
seems exhaustive to me.</p>
<p>Next, we can characterize the <strong>fermentation</strong>, which we will enumerate. As of now, I’ve observed <strong>no additional fermentation</strong> (or <em>aerobic</em> coffee), <strong>anaerobic fermentation</strong>, <strong>carbonic fermentation</strong>, and <strong>lactic fermentation</strong> (this list can obviously change with new discoveries). In addition to the additional fermentation process, it is important to record the fermentation duration (in hours). Unlike Excel, it isn’t possible to invalidate this value when no fermentation occurs; however, it would be possible (though perhaps a bit excessive) to add a formula field that uses the value of <code>Fermentation_duration</code> if fermentation is not <code>None</code> and returns <code>0</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Soaking</strong> during fermentation is a <em>boolean</em> (for which the same
technique could be applied as for fermentation duration, since soaking
only makes sense for additionally fermented coffee). One might regret
the absence of the fruits or aromas used for soaking, but in my
experience, the <strong>list of flavors</strong> (<code>Flavours</code>) provided by the
roaster is sufficient to form an opinion.</p>
<p>The <strong>roast level</strong> is a fairly imprecise indicator. In specialty
coffee, values like <code>dark</code> and <code>extradark</code> are almost never used, as
roasters generally aim to preserve the trace of the
terroir. Typically, the higher the roast level, the more the coffee
tends toward bitterness, which is generally a characteristic one wants
to avoid (or at least control). After several years of use, I
generally only use the values <code>light</code> and <code>middle</code>. Since there is no
real consensus on roast level classification, my approach is quite
approximate.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altitude</strong> field may seem surprising; indeed, we could have
placed it at the farm level. However, I imagine that some farms may
extend their plantations over several hectares and therefore
potentially across multiple altitude levels. I haven’t yet found a
compact and ergonomic way to manage <em>blends</em> of multiple beans from
multiple harvest levels.</p>
<p>The final field is the <strong>SCA Score</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_coffee#Definition">a score designed to grade
specialty
coffee</a>,
established by the <a href="https://sca.coffee">Specialty Coffee
Association</a>. Its value is therefore a <strong>highly
revealing</strong> indicator of the overall quality of the coffee.</p>
<p>Even though the model is, unfortunately, not perfect, in my view it is
sufficient to build a solid intuition about <em>my general appreciation
of coffee</em>.</p>
<h5 id="trivial-improvement"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trivial-improvement"></a>Trivial improvement</h5>
<p>When I shared the article on various networks, <a href="https://github.com/q-rault">Quentin
Rault</a> kindly pointed out in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7155947052378521600?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7155947052378521600%2C7156372641266716673%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287156372641266716673%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7155947052378521600%29">this
conversation</a>
that I could <strong>split</strong> the <code>beans</code> model into two models:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GreenBeans</code> describing the beans <strong>before roasting</strong>;</li>
<li><code>RoastedBeans</code> describing the beans <strong>after roasting</strong> (which
maintains a relation with <code>GreenBeans</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of this separation is that it avoids information
redundancy when roasters roast the same green beans. Indeed, producers
sell the product of their harvests to several different roasters. This
is therefore a trivial improvement that greatly enhances the model.</p>
<h5 id="a-second-tool-diversifying-experiences"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-second-tool-diversifying-experiences"></a>A second tool: diversifying experiences</h5>
<p>As in many disciplines with varied parameters — and here, the number
of fields describing <em>roasted beans</em> and the number of <em>drying
processes</em> promise a lot of diversity — experimenting with as many of
these parameters as possible is crucial! That’s why, by using a
<strong>view</strong>, such as a <a href="https://www.notion.so/help/boards">Kanban</a> view
based on the <strong>drying process</strong>, for example, it is possible to
quickly get a panoramic vision of the beans that <em>need more
testing</em>. In 2021, after building the first iteration of this table
collection to index my coffee, the Kanban view of roasted beans
quickly made me realize that <strong>I had somewhat neglected <em>Honey</em>
coffees</strong>, allowing me to adjust my purchases to diversify my coffee
knowledge! With this relatively modular model, it’s possible to play
with views, their dynamic feeds, and filters to highlight
low-consumption signals.</p>
<p>Now, we can move on to the final modeling step, which will leverage
all the previous steps: the recipes!</p>
<h3 id="modelling-recipes-and-experiments"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#modelling-recipes-and-experiments"></a>Modelling recipes and experiments</h3>
<p>Even though we’ve modeled a few tables and can <em>relatively precisely</em>
describe roasted beans, it’s noticeable that at no point have we
captured the interpretation (whether we like a cup or not). While we
could have added a <code>Personal_score</code> field (in contrast to the <em>SCA</em>
score) in the roasted beans table, I think it would have been a
<em>somewhat vague</em> field. Indeed, although it is possible to extract <strong>a
lot of information</strong> from our current model, there are still many
parameters that, in my view, should not be associated with the
description of the beans. The freshness of the coffee (its roasting
date) and the preparation method play a crucial role in the
appreciation of a cup.</p>
<p>Storing recipe experiments has allowed me, over time, to adjust chosen
recipes based on the characteristics of the coffee, but also to
fine-tune <em>the default parameters of a recipe</em> to approach the ideal
recipe on the first try. To enable meaningful entry of preparations,
we will separate the description of the recipe from its
experimentation. But before describing the recipe, let’s look at the
description of the coffee machines.</p>
<h4 id="describing-coffee-machines"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-coffee-machines"></a>Describing coffee machines</h4>
<p>Even though, quite naively, one might think that describing a coffee
machine only involves giving it a name — and therefore doesn’t require
a dedicated table — it quickly becomes clear that <em>for convenience</em>,
we want a hierarchical representation.</p>
<p>Indeed, to characterize a machine, I can either use a
<a href="https://www.notion.so/help/database-properties"><em>Multi-Select</em></a>,
giving me flexibility regarding the level of granularity I want, or I
can describe a set of hierarchical tables. In the original version of
the article, I used a multi-select, but in this revision, I decided to
use two tables: the first allows me to describe the <strong>machine
category</strong> (for example, <em>Pour Over</em>, <em>French Press</em>, <em>Aeropress</em>,
<em>Espresso</em>, etc.), and the second describes the <strong>specific coffee
maker</strong> in more detail.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-brewer.svg" alt="Coffee Maker Modellisation" ></p>
<p>Nothing special to note, but this breakdown allows us to describe a
recipe for a <strong>category of coffee makers</strong> and associate an experiment
with a <strong>specific coffee maker</strong>. Now, we can move on to describing a
recipe.</p>
<h4 id="describing-a-recipe"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-a-recipe"></a>Describing a recipe</h4>
<p>Now we can move on to the fun part: describing a recipe! For this,
we’ll use a Notion feature I mentioned briefly when describing coffee
varieties. Indeed, <strong>an entry in a Notion table automatically attaches
a document</strong>. We’ll use a table to describe the recipe’s metadata, and
then <strong>use the body of the entry to detail the different extraction
steps</strong>. Previously, I experimented with finer levels of modeling,
treating the steps as entries in a table as well, but it was quite
uncomfortable, and the over-normalization made describing a recipe
cumbersome.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-recipe.svg" alt="Recipe Modellisation" ></p>
<p>The first fields are quite obvious: we <strong>name</strong> the recipe, assign it
a <strong>source</strong> (usually the page or video describing it), and associate
it with a <strong>machine category</strong>. Since some recipes are specifically
<em>designed</em> for a particular machine, the <strong>Recommended Machine</strong> field
allows us to capture this detail.</p>
<p>The <strong>water temperature</strong> is a factor that greatly influences the
recipe, as does the <strong>grind size</strong> (which I count in the number of
clicks on my <a href="https://www.comandantegrinder.com/">Commandante C40</a>
grinder). The final field, the <strong>ratio</strong>, allows us to compactly
express the <em>water-to-coffee</em> proportion.</p>
<h5 id="ratio-explanation"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ratio-explanation"></a>Ratio explanation</h5>
<p>In coffee preparation descriptions found in the literature, it’s
common to encounter a ratio. The ratio is a compact notation that
describes the relationship between the amount of water and coffee
needed for a preparation. This notation avoids the imprecision of
volumetric measures (for example, 2 tablespoons of coffee) and relies
solely on weight. Typically, the ratio is expressed as <code>1:X</code>, which
can be read as <code>1g of coffee for Xg of water</code>.</p>
<p>For example, a ratio <em>typical of gentle brewing methods</em>, <code>1:18</code>,
allows you to quickly calculate either the amount of water needed for
a given portion of coffee or the amount of coffee needed for a given
portion of water (the magic of arithmetic):</p>
<ul>
<li>For 20g of coffee: <code>20 * 18</code> = <code>360g</code> of water</li>
<li>For 240g of water: <code>240 / 18</code> = <code>~13g</code> of coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>In my model, I only store the <code>X</code> from the formula, with the <code>1</code> being
constant, which allows me to use it numerically in a tool.</p>
<h5 id="a-third-tool-a-ratio-assistant"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-third-tool-a-ratio-assistant"></a>A third tool: a Ratio assistant</h5>
<p>Now that we understand the ratio, we can create a new tool that allows
us to define <strong>the amount of water to use for a specific recipe</strong>
based on a given amount of coffee. We often prefer to calculate the
water amount from the coffee rather than the reverse because it’s
usually the coffee quantity that dictates the recipe, not the other
way around, and generally, we choose the coffee before pouring the
water.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll create an <code>inline</code> database on our <code>tools</code> page,
which will contain only a single entry. In addition to the name, it
will have 4 fields:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Recipe</code>, a relation to the recipe we want to use as a base;</li>
<li><code>Ratio</code>, a rollup on the <code>Recipe</code> relation pointing to the <code>Ratio</code>
field, allowing the recipe’s ratio to be accessible;</li>
<li><code>Coffee</code>, a numeric field that will hold the amount of coffee used;</li>
<li><code>Water</code>, a <code>formula</code> field that will display the required amount of
water.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that our fields are set up, we can build the formula. Even though
the arithmetic operation is very simple, Notion’s relation model
introduces a few complications. Indeed, it is <strong>not possible</strong> to
enforce that a field has only one relation, which means the formula
must be written like this: <code>prop(&quot;Coffee&quot;) * prop(&quot;Ratio&quot;).at(0)</code>. This can be read as: <em>multiply the &quot;Coffee&quot;
property by the first value of &quot;Ratio&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>This tool highlights some inherent limitations of Notion, which can be
annoying when trying to build more ambitious tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impossibility of defining a unique relation;</li>
<li>The impossibility of setting a maximum table size. Here, we would
like to limit our table to a single entry to create a true <em>widget</em>;</li>
<li>The requirement of having a primary key (<code>Name</code>), which, in the case
of a single-entry table, doesn’t really make sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though these issues exist and are closely tied to Notion’s
<em>table-oriented</em> model, it is often possible to find a solution
(sometimes a bit verbose) to work around the problem.</p>
<h4 id="describing-an-experimentation"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#describing-an-experimentation"></a>Describing an experimentation</h4>
<p>At this stage, we have all the building blocks necessary to <strong>truly
characterize our tasting experience</strong>! We can now describe each
<strong>experience</strong>. An experience is <strong>the application of a recipe with a
specific machine and specific beans</strong>. This is the part that will
finally allow us to gather appreciation metrics. In other words, an
experiment is both a variation and a specialization of a recipe.</p>
<p>Since a recipe serves as a guide, some parameters are duplicated to
allow adjustments based on the coffee used or the machine. As with the
steps of a recipe, we can use the document attached to each entry to
collect additional notes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coffee-exp.svg" alt="Experience Modellisation" ></p>
<p>Many of the fields have already been described in the previous
models. Note that for each recipe, I store the <strong>roasting date</strong>,
which is an important indicator of the freshness of the roasted
coffee. Indeed, it is common to let the coffee <em>degass</em> for a few days
after roasting. Personally, I tend to let the coffee rest for up to a
week <em>post-roasting</em> and consume it within the following three weeks.</p>
<p>The <strong>Personal Score</strong> is a rating (out of 20) that allows me to
capture a general impression of the quality of my cup. This is why
it’s important to record the time at which I consumed the coffee
(here, the <strong>Date</strong> field), because some coffees, in my view, aren’t
suitable for the morning (for example, fermented coffees). This field
will be crucial in the following sections, as it will allow us to
extract interesting metrics.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ratio</strong> field allows us to calculate the ratio (logically) based
on the amounts of water and coffee, and its formula is quite simple:
<code>prop(&quot;Water_quantity&quot;) / prop(&quot;Coffee_quantity&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Coffee Freshness</strong> field is a simple subtraction, showing the
result in <strong>weeks</strong> between the preparation date and the roast date,
represented by the following formula:
<code>prop(&quot;Date&quot;).dateBetween(prop(&quot;Torrefaction_date&quot;), &quot;weeks&quot;)</code>, which
demonstrates that Notion’s formula language is also very expressive
when working with dates.</p>
<p>We have finished the modeling. At this stage, the exercise of entering
this kind of information is already, in my opinion, a significant step
toward understanding one’s coffee preferences. We will conclude by
leveraging a <strong>relationship-based feature</strong> to build <strong>refined summary
tools</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="more-dashboards"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#more-dashboards"></a>More dashboards</h2>
<p>Now that we have a <em>complete</em> data collection foundation, we will look
at how to slightly modify our models to extract <strong>fun and relevant
insights</strong>. For example, how to sort my favorite coffees, highlight
the farms that produce the coffees I enjoy most, or identify which
machines produce the results I like best. In the current setup,
collecting all these metrics dynamically is quite
challenging. However, thanks to a very useful feature in Notion, it is
possible to implement them.</p>
<p>For this article, we will focus on a single problem: based on
<strong>experiment scores</strong>, how can we sort:</p>
<ul>
<li>the coffees I prefer;</li>
<li>the roasters that give me the most satisfaction;</li>
<li>the farms/producers that produce the coffees I enjoy the most.</li>
</ul>
<p>By working through this example <em>in sequence</em>, a series of
increasingly complex dashboards becomes trivial to implement. To keep
the article from ballooning in size, we will stick to this single
example.</p>
<h3 id="bidirectional-relationships"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bidirectional-relationships"></a>Bidirectional relationships</h3>
<p>In a relation’s properties, there is an option called <code>Show on relation_source</code>. When checked, it adds a field in the source of the
relation that lists all entities linked to a given entry. For example,
if in the <code>experimentations</code> table I check <code>Show on</code> for <code>Beans</code>, then
for each entry in <code>Beans</code>, I will see all the experimentations based
on those beans. Coupled with <strong>Rollups</strong>, this allows aggregating
values and surfacing insights automatically.</p>
<h4 id="bidirectional-relations-and-rollups-average-score"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bidirectional-relations-and-rollups-average-score"></a>Bidirectional Relations and Rollups: Average Score</h4>
<p>Now that all our experimentations are accessible by beans through the
<code>Beans</code> table, we can <strong>add a Rollup</strong> pointing to the
<code>experimentations</code> field, selecting the <code>Personal_score</code> property and
using <code>Average</code> as the <strong>calculation function</strong>. This will compute the
average of personal scores for each bean. To apply the same logic to
calculate the average score of a roaster or a farm, we <strong>duplicate
this calculated field using the mirror-field technique</strong> (since the
average is the result of a Rollup) and make the relations between
roasted beans and roasters/farms <strong>bi-directional</strong>. Then, in the
<code>Roasters</code> and <code>Farms</code> tables, we can add a Rollup on these newly
modified relations, again using the <code>Average</code> calculation
function. This way, each roaster and farm will display an <strong>average
score</strong> reflecting all experimentations of the beans they produced.</p>
<p>We now have an <strong>average experimentation score per bean</strong>, an
<strong>average bean score per roaster</strong>, and an <strong>average bean score per
producer</strong>. This setup allows us to create <strong>dedicated views</strong> to
display my favorite beans, my favorite roasters, and my favorite
farms!</p>
<p>For me, after several years of indexing, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fincahartmann/?hl=fr">Finca
Hartmann</a> is the farm
to which I have given the highest score, and
<a href="https://www.cime-cafe.fr/">Cime</a> is the top-rated roaster.</p>
<p>By leveraging the bi-directional propagation of relations, mirrored
fields, and Rollups, it’s possible to surface interesting metrics, and
the possibilities are incredibly varied. For example, one could even
automate the calculation of the <code>tested</code> checkbox using a similar
approach—if there’s at least one experimentation referencing a roaster
(in other words, if the experimentation field isn’t empty), then it
can be marked as tested! This concludes my process and coffee indexing
system; it’s time to wrap up.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-up"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#to-sum-up"></a>To sum up</h2>
<p>The article, unfortunately, turned out to be longer than I had hoped,
and I think that to conclude properly, this section should be divided
into several parts. The first will focus on the concrete benefits of
the indexing tool, the second on Notion and, more specifically, on
<em>LowCode</em>, and the last will touch on the hypothetical future I
envision for this system.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope this article has conveyed, even a little, my
passion for coffee! It’s a fascinating world, driven by fascinating
people. Much of my interest in coffee truly began to develop thanks to
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/clementfaivre/">Clément</a> during the days of
the now-missed Coøk Kaffé, which allowed me to discover
<a href="https://www.aprilcoffeeroasters.com/">April</a>. It deepened thanks to
the expertise of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/baptistedmrt/">Baptiste</a>
and the entire team at <a href="https://www.cime-cafe.fr/">Cime</a>, whose coffee
is excellent (and has become my favorite roaster), with a special
mention for <a href="https://www.substancecafe.com/">Substance</a>, where every
reservation promises an incredible journey and discoveries, enriched
with loads of information about the terroir, producers, and brewing
methods, and
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/kultivar_cafe_nantes/">Kultivar</a>, which
gave me the opportunity to taste very original and exotic fermented
coffees!</p>
<p>What makes the specialty coffee world even <em>cooler</em> than just being
able to drink good coffee is that it’s lifted by people who are
generous with advice, discussion, and sharing!</p>
<h3 id="after-2-years-of-use"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#after-2-years-of-use"></a>After ~2 years of use</h3>
<p>Before I started meticulously recording my experiments in the index
presented in this article, I primarily relied on the <strong>branding</strong> and
artistic direction of roasters to discover new coffees. Using an index
allowed me, <strong>during a discovery phase</strong>, to deliberately diversify my
choices, to understand — contextually — the appeal and appreciation I
could have for certain coffees, and to build a strong intuition about
the aromas and the acidity/bitterness balance I usually look for in a
cup. It also helped me find <strong>relevant first settings</strong> to experiment
with new coffees. Moreover, the exercise of <strong>documentation</strong> is truly
a fantastic tool to <strong>stabilize one’s knowledge</strong>, and even though I
still consider myself very much a beginner in the coffee world, I
believe I have been able to <strong>learn more</strong> and progress significantly
thanks to this meticulous indexing.</p>
<p>In short, I believe that in many disciplines, building <strong>indexes,
knowledge bases, or dictionaries</strong> is a valuable practice. For me,
creating this coffee index has been genuinely useful, while also
allowing me to produce <strong>two articles</strong> — which, given my almost
nonexistent writing productivity, is quite the bonus!</p>
<h3 id="on-notion-and-lowcode"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#on-notion-and-lowcode"></a>On Notion and LowCode</h3>
<p>Even though, as a developer, one might regret some of the <strong>necessary
workarounds</strong>, I found Notion ergonomic and really fun to use. From my
perspective, the model—sitting at the intersection of relational
tables and <strong>spreadsheets</strong> — is highly versatile, and when combined
with its <a href="https://developers.notion.com/">API</a>, it can be used as a
true <strong>back-end</strong>, quickly providing a UI for structured data. This
was my first <strong>LowCode/NoCode</strong> experience (outside of Excel), and I
wasn’t disappointed. Even using just a small subset of the application
(and missing out on many features), I was very impressed by the
<strong>prototyping speed</strong> that such a tool enables.</p>
<p>I will continue to <strong>keep an eye</strong> on alternatives (ideally
open-source and <strong>local-first</strong>) and keep experimenting with
<strong>LowCode</strong> technologies to solve problems I don’t particularly want
to develop <strong>from scratch</strong>. If you have any feedback — <em>positive or
negative</em> — about Notion, or suggestions for <strong>LowCode/NoCode</strong> tools
to try, don’t hesitate to reach out; I’d be delighted to explore them.</p>
<p>In short, although it’s not possible with Notion to build <strong>everything
that could be built</strong> with a full relational database and a dedicated
front-end, the tool covers a huge number of use cases and offers a
very high level of generality, combined with excellent
ergonomics. It’s probably worth seeing what <strong>LowCode</strong> has to
offer. In my case, Notion allowed me to benefit from a graphical
interface — more or less ergonomic — based on data description and
structure, <strong>for free</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-sequel"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-sequel"></a>The Sequel</h3>
<p>The construction of the system and its documentation (this article and
its predecessor) were fun exercises, resulting in a tool that I use
daily. However, I believe that to make it <strong>generically
ergonomic</strong> — meaning usable by someone other than <strong>myself</strong>, and
therefore potentially publishable as a <strong>template</strong> or at least
distributable — there is still <strong>a lot of work</strong> to do. Throughout this
article, I’ve pointed out small points of frustration. They might
exist only because I don’t fully master Notion (and if that’s the
case, please don’t hesitate to contact me to explain how to improve my
system), but I think that, like any tool <em>so versatile</em>, designed to
be easy to pick up, it’s impossible to precisely define certain
relational constraints or formatting rules. That’s why it’s
conceivable (<em>hypothetically</em>) that I might develop a dedicated
software (free, of course) to <em>relax</em> all these constraints!</p>
<p>In any case, the Notion prototype is extremely helpful, as it provided
a first modeling, making the use of <strong>LowCode</strong> as a prototyping tool
perfectly relevant.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t hesitate to drink good coffee, ditch the <em>Nespresso</em>
machines, stop buying over-roasted supermarket coffee (like <em>Carte
Noire</em> or <em>Grand Mère</em>), and allow yourself to enjoy specialty coffee
— cultivated, harvested, dried, and roasted with care. <strong>It’s far
better</strong>. Promise.</p>
