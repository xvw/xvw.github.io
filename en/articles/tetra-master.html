</section><article class="synopsis"><p><em>Tetra Master</em> is the optional card game in <strong>Final Fantasy IX</strong>. At first glance, it seems similar to <em>Triple Triad</em> — the card game from Final Fantasy VIII. And while you can develop a general intuition for how to win, especially if you have strong cards, after playing over a hundred matches, I had to admit something: just playing the game and reading all the <em>in-game</em> tutorials wasn’t enough to truly understand the rules. Eventually, I gave in and started looking things up to figure out what I was missing. The complete absence of <strong>any actual rules</strong> — whether in the game or the manual — left me utterly frustrated, which is what led me to write this article, illustrated in OCaml.</p>

Master card game</strong>. While I can fully understand (and even agree with)
some of the criticisms directed at the ninth entry in the series, I
personally enjoyed the game a lot — maybe out of nostalgia. And since
the card game isn't required to progress through the main story, it's
entirely possible to enjoy the game while carrying only a mild sense
of frustration at not grasping the intricate — and arguably
unguessable — mechanics of its ruleset.</p>
<p>Some people will probably find it pretty strange to revisit this game
<strong>more than 22 years</strong> after its European release... and honestly,
they’re not wrong! I have to admit, I find it quite amusing to try and
turn this website into <em>a sort of dusty old library</em>, filled with
<em>useless knowledge</em>.</p>
<h3 id="context"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#context"></a>Context</h3>
<p>I discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy">Final
Fantasy</a> series through
its seventh installment in the late ’90s, watching my cousin Thomas
play it with rapt attention. I was deeply impressed and quickly became
a big fan of the series for its atmosphere, music, and stories. That
said, being very young at the time and having only played
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games#Japanese_role-playing_games">JRPGs</a>
like Pokémon Red, I didn’t care much about game mechanics — which
might sound awful to you, as I was missing out on what truly makes a
video game <strong>a</strong> game — so I rarely read the tutorials and just
focused on progressing through the story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though the Final Fantasy series — at least the entries released
in Europe at that time — isn’t known for being particularly
difficult, ignoring the understanding of systems like the
<a href="http://ff7.fr/materias.php">materia</a> system in Final Fantasy VII
can make progressing through the adventure <strong>very challenging</strong>. And
yes, while Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and IX have a similar
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skill_ceiling"><em>Skill Ceiling</em></a> to
Pokémon Red and Blue, I have a feeling that the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skill_floor"><em>Skill
Floor</em></a> for those three
Final Fantasy games is significantly higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holding a fondness for these games I had <strong>never</strong> finished, years
later I decided to play them again with the goal of completing
them. At that time, as a programmer, my interest was focused on the
<a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/">RPGMaker</a> series — a <em>toy software</em> for
building RPGs that offers a programming interface to create original
systems and grants great customization freedom for <a href="https://www.aedemphia-rpg.net/">advanced
users</a>. Playing classics from the
genre seemed like a perfect way to learn!</p>
<p>Since <em>JRPGs</em> are often long games and I wasn’t playing like a
hardcore gamer, nearly 10 years later, after finishing FF6, FF7, and
FF8, my takeaway was clear: <strong>reading the tutorials and understanding
the various game mechanics makes the experience much easier</strong>. While
each of these entries has its own subtle complexities related more to
the <em>Skill Ceiling</em>, overall the games were quite simple — which isn’t
a criticism — and I was ready to dive into FF9 with confidence.</p>
<h4 id="simple-but-not-in-every-aspect"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#simple-but-not-in-every-aspect"></a>Simple, but not in every aspect</h4>
<p>Like its predecessors, Final Fantasy IX isn’t a complicated game. The
mechanics are easy to grasp, and although battles can sometimes feel
slow-paced — and the
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IX#Combats">Trance</a>
system can be frustrating if you’re coming from the previous two games
— it’s pretty clear how to be effective quickly. My frustration,
however, comes from the card game. Like its predecessor, the game
includes an <em>ad-hoc</em> system called <strong>Tetra Master</strong>, which is
introduced fairly early in the story. As a player, I’m generally quite
supportive of having multiple <em>ad-hoc</em> systems, especially in JRPGs,
which usually have long playtimes and, at least back then, were often
linear; these systems can sometimes shake up the pacing and add fun
side quests. In the game, Tetra Master is presented as a <em>simple</em> card
game, and you can quickly get your first cards and learn the
<em>supposed</em> rules.</p>
<p>After more than a hundred matches, and having carefully read the
various fragments of rules scattered throughout the game — especially
through Jack’s tips — I came to this conclusion: <strong>I was never truly
confident during a match</strong>, because even though I grasped the general
idea of the game, something seemed to be missing in my understanding
of the rules.</p>
<h4 id="discovering-the-rules-online"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#discovering-the-rules-online"></a>Discovering the Rules Online</h4>
<p>Frustrated that despite my experience with the game, I seemed to be
missing several subtleties, I did what I couldn’t do back then (around
2000) — I searched online. I was amused to find that, even in 2023,
there are still websites that look like they’re straight out of the
early 2000s, yet form an impressive knowledge base on the series. On
those sites, I found detailed Tetra Master rules, and sure enough, I
was missing <strong>a lot of pieces</strong> to fully understand the game’s
rules. During my research, I also came across many forum posts from
players just as disillusioned as I was. Once I discovered the rules,
another question naturally arose: &quot;<em>How did these sites figure out
these rules?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>My first instinct was to check out <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/szmanuals/6de938ebe61e9432ea99da2095150069">the original
manual</a>,
which includes a section dedicated to Tetra Master (pages <code>22</code> and
<code>23</code>). Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide more information than what
you learn in the game. However, the <strong>Card Ability Points</strong> box on
page <code>22</code> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every card has a set of numbers and letters that represents the
strength of the card, which comes into play during card
battles. Generally, the higher the number, the stronger the
card. Try to figure out the effects of numbers and letters on each
card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goodness, the manual taunts us! Digging deeper, I found a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221226113714/https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197338-final-fantasy-ix/faqs/9671">mysterious
document</a>,
published in November <strong>2000</strong> and updated until June <strong>2001</strong>, which
appears to be the foundation of the collective knowledge about the
game’s rules. The result of thorough investigation — including
inquiries to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(video_game_company)">Squaresoft</a>
and probably some <em>reverse-engineering</em> — this document was created to
establish a comprehensive set of rules for the game to be adapted into
a board game and seems to be the product of a remarkable
collaboration.</p>
<p>Another very amusing aspect of the document, beyond explaining the
rules, is that it highlights an <a href="http://archive.thegia.com/letters/l0011/19.html">extraordinary
quote</a> from a certain
<a href="http://archive.thegia.com/features/990602/staff/s10.html">Drew
Cosner</a>, a
member of the editorial team of the now-defunct <a href="http://www.thegia.com/">The Gaming
Intelligence Agency</a>, a site that closed in
2015 and specialized in video game reviews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, here it is: how the hell are you supposed to play Tetra
Masters in FFIX? As far as I can tell, you place your cards on the
board at random and your opponent randomly puts his cards down
causing random cards to flip over at random, leading to the random
card battle which is apparently won completely at random. In the
end, one of you wins. At random.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proving that I wasn’t the only one baffled by the rules, I’m simply
joining, 20 years later, the community of players disillusioned by
this strange card game — yet one so beloved by the inhabitants of the
fictional world where the story of, nonetheless, <strong>the excellent Final
Fantasy IX</strong> takes place.</p>
<h2 id="the-tetra-master"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-tetra-master"></a>The Tetra Master</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in this <em>very long</em> introduction, since the release of
the &quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221226113714/https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197338-final-fantasy-ix/faqs/9671">mysterious
document</a>,&quot;
there have been plenty of <em>online</em> resources to learn the rules of the
infernal Tetra Master. So why bother writing a new one in 2023? Even
though this article is mainly meant to vent about the complexity and
<em>non-discoverability</em> of the rules, I believe documenting the full
rules, <strong>in my own way</strong> — but based on the aforementioned document —
will support my points and also, somewhat selfishly, add content to my
site.</p>
<h3 id="cards-in-the-story"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cards-in-the-story"></a>Cards in the Story</h3>
<p>The cards are introduced very early in the game’s <em>lore</em>. In fact,
they seem to spark a special interest from
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personnages_de_Final_Fantasy_IX#Bibi_Orunitia">Bibi</a>
right from the very beginning.  By the way, during the <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Festival_of_the_Hunt">Festival of
the Hunt</a>,
Bibi demands the <a href="http://www.ff-heroes.com/final-fantasy-ix/tetra-master/liste-des-cartes/detail-de-la-carte/item/aerotheatre.html">Aerotheatre
card</a>
as a reward — a card far superior to those typically acquired at this
point in the adventure. Although the cards don’t affect story
progression or provide any bonuses, we learn that many inhabitants of
the game’s world play this card game, and there’s even a <a href="https://www.gamerguides.com/final-fantasy-ix/guide/walkthrough/disc-3/back-to-treno">card
tournament</a>
(which you can safely lose without consequences).</p>
<p>While these cards don’t grant any additional bonuses, they satisfy the
<em>collecting obsession</em> of certain players. Like many <em>ad-hoc</em> systems
in JRPGs, card matches offer a <em>slight</em> break from the game’s
linearity, building a web of small side quests that intertwine with
the main storyline and other side quests and systems.</p>
<p>In short, if the rules of the game had been inferable, its integration
would have been, in my opinion, an excellent idea (somewhat like FF8’s
<strong>Triple Triad</strong>). Unfortunately, as we’ll see... that’s absolutely
not the case!</p>
<h3 id="collecting-cards"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#collecting-cards"></a>Collecting Cards</h3>
<p>Since the cards are part of the game’s story world, it makes sense
that there are multiple ways to collect them. After discussing the
various methods for acquiring new cards, I will try to subjectively
determine the most effective approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Receiving Them from Characters</strong><br>
This is the first way we encounter cards. Right from the start of
the adventure, Bibi will have the chance to collect cards and be
taught the basics of the game (yes, just the basics — absolutely too
little information to <em>actually understand the rules</em>. Damn NPCs,
incapable of giving us comprehensive information).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding Them</strong><br>
Like any respectable JRPG, dungeons and villages are full of
treasures. In FF9, besides chests, you can discover hidden items —
brushing past them will reveal a speech bubble with an exclamation
mark. Sometimes, you'll find cards this way. Note that cards can
also be part of treasures uncovered using
<a href="https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-IX/Side-Quests/Chocographs.html">Chocographs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As a reward for battles</strong><br>
Sometimes, certain opponents <em>reward you</em> with one or more
cards. More often than not, the card you receive corresponds to one
of the monsters present in the fight — <em>logical</em>, for once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buying Them</strong><br>
You can purchase cards for <code>100 gils</code> in the town of
<a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Treno">Treno</a>. Since the price
is very low, the cards available for sale are, <em>by default</em>,
relatively unremarkable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Winning Them</strong><br>
We’ll go into detail about the rules later, but winning card matches
allows you to take one or five cards from your opponent upon
victory. Since some NPCs are experienced players — especially in the
Treno card tournament — it’s possible to collect powerful cards once
you reach a certain point in the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Naively looking at this list, one might quickly conclude that the most
effective way to collect the maximum number of cards is to challenge
as many opponents as possible. However, and this is the core of this
article, since the game is very complicated, I firmly believe that to
build an effective <em>deck</em>, it’s better to <strong>fight as many monsters as
possible</strong>. Indeed, monsters encountered randomly have a chance to
drop a card as a reward. Besides the card, fighting monsters also
grants experience and other items, giving card collecting a concrete
purpose tied to progressing through the adventure. That said,
challenging opponents is also necessary, as we’ll see when we delve
into the rules in detail.</p>
<h4 id="a-brief-note-on-randomness"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-brief-note-on-randomness"></a>A Brief Note on Randomness</h4>
<p>Each card has several attributes that determine its strength, so two
cards with the same artwork can actually differ. A point that is <em>both
fun and frustrating</em> is that these <strong>attributes aren’t set until you
actually obtain the card</strong>. In other words, cards given by other
characters or found in villages and dungeons have their
characteristics determined <strong>upon discovery</strong>. It’s therefore possible
— and recommended — to <em>save your game</em> before collecting a card and
reload until you’re satisfied with its stats. This trick works for all
cards, including rare ones.</p>
<p>Throughout this guide, I will frequently complain about
<strong>randomness</strong>, which amplifies the game's <em>non-determinism</em>. The
variability in the stats of a card found or received is the first
clear example of this.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-according-to-the-manual"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-rules-according-to-the-manual"></a>The Rules According to the Manual</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the <em>context</em> section of this article, <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/szmanuals/6de938ebe61e9432ea99da2095150069">the original
manual</a>
devotes two pages to Tetra Master. Overall, the information provided
in the manual isn’t much more detailed than what you can gather in the
game. However, to help you understand my frustration, I’m going to
paraphrase it here — which will make the detailed explanation
following this section all the more impressive!</p>
<h4 id="challenging-an-opponent"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#challenging-an-opponent"></a>Challenging an Opponent</h4>
<p>This is probably the most comprehensive part of the guide: indeed,
some NPCs play cards. To challenge them, simply approach and interact
by pressing the <strong>square</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="basic-rules"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#basic-rules"></a>Basic Rules</h4>
<p>This section outlines the game flow <em>in very broad terms</em>, leaving out
many details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You and your opponent take turns placing 5 cards each on a 4x4
grid. Cards can be won from your opponent depending on where they
are placed. Once all cards are placed, the player who owns the most
cards wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this, we understand that the goal is to capture as many of your
opponent’s cards as possible. What follows are the different methods
of capturing cards.</p>
<h5 id="winning-a-card"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#winning-a-card"></a>Winning a Card</h5>
<p>In the various diagrams, black cards represent the player’s cards and
gray cards represent the opponent’s. The card marked with a circle is
the one that was just placed, and the arrow between card patterns
indicates the effect of that placement.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;<em>You win an opponent’s card when an arrow on your card points toward
the opponent’s card.</em>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-1.png" alt="Pointing an oponent" ></p>
<p>From this first (very incomplete) bit of information, we can deduce
several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards have arrows — since the opponent’s card in the example has
none, we can assume that cards have a variable number of arrows,
pointing in different directions;</li>
<li>It’s reasonable to assume that cards must be adjacent for one to be
captured;</li>
<li>A captured card stays in its position but changes color to reflect
the player who now owns it.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>&quot;<em>If an arrow on your card faces an arrow on your opponent’s card, a
<strong>battle</strong> occurs. The numbers shown on the cards are subtracted, and
the card with the higher resulting value wins the other</em>.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-2.png" alt="Battle situation" ></p>
<p>The battle mechanic, as shown in the diagram, reveals new elements
about how the game works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards have <strong>stats</strong>;</li>
<li>It confirms our earlier assumption that the arrows on cards vary.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>&quot;<em>When you win a battle, all cards targeted by the arrows of the newly
captured card are also captured</em>.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-3.png" alt="Victory Situation" ></p>
<p>The main idea illustrated by this diagram is that, in addition to the
arrows, it’s possible to create a <em>capture chain</em> — a <strong>combo</strong> that
spreads the success of a capture to all adjacent arrows. However, this
section raises more questions than it answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do <em>combos</em> propagate recursively? (This can be answered quickly by
playing a few matches)</li>
<li>If a captured card — as part of a combo — is placed into a battle
scenario, does that battle still occur?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the manual states that cards have
stats — something we also saw during the battle example. However, it
explicitly says that it <strong>won’t explain</strong> how to interpret those
stats, and as we’ll see, deciphering them is far from straightforward
without help.</p>
<h5 id="rewards-and-penalties"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rewards-and-penalties"></a>Rewards and Penalties</h5>
<p>At the end of a match, the winner can choose <strong>one</strong> card from those
they successfully captured from the opponent. However, if the winner
manages to <strong>capture all of the opponent’s cards</strong> — achieving a
<strong><em>Perfect Game</em></strong> — they get to take <strong>all</strong> of the opponent’s
cards. This is quite a windfall when you win, but can be incredibly
punishing if you lose.</p>
<p>We also learn that it’s possible to reclaim lost cards by rematching
NPCs who have defeated you.</p>
<h4 id="card-limit-and-menu"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#card-limit-and-menu"></a>Card Limit and Menu</h4>
<p>A small note tells us that you <strong>cannot own more than 100 cards</strong> and
that you can get rid of cards from the <strong>card menu</strong>. This is a
strange choice because, as the card menu reveals, there are <strong>100
different cards</strong> in total. We can therefore assume that once you are
advanced in your card collection, building a strategy that uses
multiple copies of the same card becomes difficult. Moreover,
consulting this menu anticipates the frustration you'll feel during
your first games, as it displays information that cannot be linked to
what you learned from reading the manual.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion-from-reading-the-manual"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion-from-reading-the-manual"></a>Conclusion from Reading the Manual</h4>
<p>Although some aspects remain unclear, one might think that the general
logic of the game has been grasped and that these uncertainties will
disappear through playing. Let me reassure you right away: <strong>this is
absolutely not the case</strong>. While the manual offers a few strategies —
quite easy to discover on your own and thus not included here — it
seems to deliberately leave a set of unknowns for players to figure
out in-game. However, if you’re like me, you’ll find that the
combination of randomness and sparse information, especially regarding
card stats, makes this discovery tedious — if not <em>impossible</em> — which
has made Tetra Master the subject of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/vuq3wc/oh_my_god_tetra_master_is_absolutely_awful/">many
mockeries</a>. Fortunately,
thanks to the internet and the patience of some enthusiasts, the rules
are now known, and in the following sections, I’ll try to provide a
clear description! The only two points I won’t revisit are using the
square button to start a match and the rewards, mainly because these
are probably the only parts thoroughly explained in the manual
(thankfully).</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s dive into a <em>meticulous</em> description of
Tetra Master’s rules. You’ll see, the surprises are far from over.</p>
<h3 id="detailed-rules"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#detailed-rules"></a>Detailed Rules</h3>
<p>Since the game is played between two players, each starting with five
cards, the two prerequisites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have at least 5 cards;</li>
<li>Find an opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these conditions are met, starting a match involves interacting
with a character using, by default, the square button. You will be
asked to choose the five cards you want to use. One might argue that
ideally you should pick your five best cards; however, since you can
lose either one or all five cards, you also need to weigh the <em>risk
and reward</em> (as we’ll see later, <em>combos</em> can turn the tide).</p>
<p>When a match begins, a coin toss decides who places the first card —
the player has a <strong>50/50 chance</strong> to start. After that, each player
takes turns placing one card at a time.</p>
<h4 id="game-board"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#game-board"></a>Game Board</h4>
<p>The game board is a <code>4x4</code> grid, consisting of 16 spaces. To add
variety, the start of a match can <strong>randomly</strong> block between 0 and 6
spaces (once again adding randomness), where no cards can be
placed. Since a maximum of 6 spaces can be blocked, there will always
be enough room to play all five cards.</p>
<p>Here are three examples of possible boards. The first has no blocked
spaces, the second has <code>3</code> blocked spaces, and the last has <code>6</code>
blocked spaces.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-board.png" alt="Game board" ></p>
<p>Although I complained about the excessive randomness in the
introduction, here I find the slight variations in the board layout to
be a <strong>very good idea</strong>, allowing players to devise complementary
strategies. For example, in the third example, the isolated spot with
no adjacent free spaces lets you place a weaker card that can never be
captured, preventing a <em>perfect defeat</em> and ensuring that, at worst,
you lose only one card.</p>
<h4 id="simple-card-capture"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#simple-card-capture"></a>Simple Card Capture</h4>
<p>We saw in the manual that to capture a card, you simply place a card,
and all cards pointed to by its arrows are captured. In this example,
the black card captures three targeted cards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-4.png" alt="Placing on board" ></p>
<p>However, for the arrows to be effective, <strong>the card must have just
been placed</strong>. In this diagram, the grey card does not affect the
newly played black card:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-5.png" alt="Result of card placement" ></p>
<p>Because a played card is <strong>offensive</strong>, and once placed, it switches
to <strong>defensive</strong> mode. For a card that has already been placed to
capture another, a <strong>battle</strong> and/or a <strong>combo</strong> must occur — both of
which we'll explain in the following sections.</p>
<h4 id="battle"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#battle"></a>Battle</h4>
<p>At this point in the article, you might be thinking I’ve been
exaggerating the game’s complexity — and that, even if the manual
wasn’t thorough, a few matches should be enough to grasp the full
mechanics! Rest assured, in this section, we’ll quickly see why
playing Tetra Master without understanding key information tied to
card stats — which only become apparent during battle situations —
leads to constant low-grade anxiety. You’ll frequently find yourself
unsure of why you’re winning... or worse, losing.</p>
<p>As a reminder, when placing a card adjacent to another card of a
different color, several scenarios can occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the placed card points to one or more opponent cards, and none of
those cards have arrows pointing back, it simply captures all
targeted cards.</li>
<li>If the placed card doesn’t point to any opposing card — even if it
is pointed at by an already-placed card — no capture happens.</li>
<li>If the placed card points to one or more opponent cards and one of
those cards points back, a <strong>battle</strong> occurs. The placed card is the
<strong>attacker</strong>, and the targeted card is the <strong>defender</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-2.png" alt="Battle situation" ></p>
<p>We also read that, in a battle situation, the <em>card with the highest
number wins</em>. And what’s amazing is... before diving into the rules,
the obscure document, and a few attempts at <em>reverse engineering</em>, I
was <strong>completely unable</strong> to understand how <em>that number</em> was
determined. Buckle up — I think this is the point where the designers
of Tetra Master — and whoever signed off on the <em>Game Design Document</em>
— completely lost it. Because from my perspective, <strong>even after
playing thousands of matches, it’s impossible to figure out how this
<em>number</em> is defined</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="multiple-battles"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#multiple-battles"></a>Multiple Battles</h5>
<p>Although we haven’t yet fully broken down the anatomy of a card, we’ve
speculated that a card can have multiple arrows, potentially pointing
to several different cards. For example, in this situation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-multiple-battle.png" alt="Multiple Battles" ></p>
<p>In this situation, we can see that the played card is in a <strong>battle
situation</strong> with both opposing cards. While the game usually decides
randomly or applies a questionably explicit rule to determine battle
order, <strong>the attacking player chooses which card to attack
first</strong>. This allows for genuine strategic play, as we’ll explain
further when discussing <em>combos</em>.</p>
<h5 id="card-anatomy"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#card-anatomy"></a>Card Anatomy</h5>
<p>A card — which is generally more visually appealing than my simple
diagrams — can have between 0 and 8 directional arrows, each
representing an attack direction — and, as we’ve seen in battles, also
defense directions. It might seem strange to have (and use) cards
without any arrows, as they would be <em>completely</em> ineffective — only
able to be captured and never able to capture others. However, such
cards can be surprisingly useful to break <em>combos</em> or, as a last move,
to simply add a <code>+1</code> to your count of captured cards.</p>
<p>Next, each card has a sort of cryptic identifier, hard to decipher —
especially on a CRT television. For example, here is the diagram of a
card that can attack in all directions, with the identifier: <code>1P23</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-card-template.png" alt="Card Anatomy" ></p>
<p>I believe we have a fairly good grasp of the arrow mechanics and their
role, so we can speculate that the identifier describes a card’s stats
and is used to calculate the <em>number</em> that determines a
<em>battle</em>. That’s exactly right, but we’ll see there are many <em>implicit
rules</em> making the understanding of these numbers <strong>very challenging</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="reading-a-cards-statistics"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reading-a-cards-statistics"></a>Reading a Card’s Statistics</h5>
<p>From my perspective, it’s <em>probably impossible</em> to deduce the
relationship behind that infamous <em>identifier</em> (in our example, the
notorious <code>1P23</code>). So I’ll be very explicit: it provides four pieces
of information about the card, in this format: <code>PTDM</code>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>P</code> is the card’s <strong>offensive power</strong>, expressed in <strong>hexadecimal</strong>,
from <code>0</code> to <code>F</code>; in our example, the value is <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>T</code> is the <strong>card type</strong>, which can be <code>P</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>X</code>, or <code>A</code>; in our
example, the value is <code>P</code>.</li>
<li><code>D</code> is the card’s <strong>physical defense</strong>, also expressed in
<strong>hexadecimal</strong>, from <code>0</code> to <code>F</code>; in our example, the value is <code>2</code>.</li>
<li><code>M</code> is the card’s <strong>magical defense</strong>, also expressed in
<strong>hexadecimal</strong>, from <code>0</code> to <code>F</code>; in our example, the value is <code>3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I assure you that the fact that these digits are expressed in
hexadecimal can be very confusing once you start progressing in the
card adventure. Indeed, neither the game nor the manual <strong>ever</strong>
explains how to read these statistics. Having been used to seeing at
least three digits, suddenly seeing letters appear can cause a lot of
confusion! Especially since the statistic <code>AAAA</code> is <strong>perfectly
valid</strong>. So even if, like me, years after your first encounters with
Tetra Master, you have a background in computer science and decide,
<em>naively</em>, to give its baffling complexity another try — even if you
are already familiar with the hexadecimal numbering system — chances
are you won’t realize it’s actually hexadecimal, since the pattern of
the statistics doesn’t look anything like a number expressed in any
known numeric system.</p>
<p>Before diving into the <strong>concrete meaning</strong> of these hexadecimal
values (because yes, it’s way more complicated than you might think),
let’s look at the different types of cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>P</code> (for <em>physical</em>) is a card that uses its <strong>offensive power</strong> to
attack the <strong>physical defense</strong> of another card. For example, in a
situation where <code>7P23</code> attacks <code>2M12</code>, we roughly have <code>7</code> vs <code>1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>M</code> (for <em>magical</em>) is a card that uses its <strong>offensive power</strong> to
attack, logically, the <strong>magical defense</strong> of another card. For
example, in a situation where <code>2M12</code> attacks <code>7P23</code>, we roughly have
<code>2</code> vs <code>3</code> once again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X</code> (for ... <em>power</em> (haha) or, according to some translations,
<em>flexible</em>) is a card that uses its <strong>offensive power</strong> to attack
<strong>the weaker of the two defenses</strong> of another card. So, in a
situation where <code>7X12</code> attacks <code>2M32</code>, the card targets the magical
defense. Roughly speaking, once again, it’s <code>7</code> vs <code>2</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>A</code> (for <em>advanced</em> or <em>assault</em>) is a card that uses <strong>its highest
statistic</strong> (whether offensive <strong>or</strong> defensive) to attack <strong>the
lowest relevant statistic</strong> (including offensive power) of another
card. For example, in a situation where <code>2A8F</code> attacks <code>1X2F</code>, the
card uses its magical defense to target the opponent's offensive
power, roughly <code>F</code> vs <code>1</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to assert that <code>FAFF</code> is the best possible stat
combination for a card. We’ll see later that cards can be <em>upgraded</em>,
but one challenge at a time! First, let’s look at how to interpret the
hexadecimal digits.</p>
<h5 id="interpreting-hexadecimal-statistics"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#interpreting-hexadecimal-statistics"></a>Interpreting Hexadecimal Statistics</h5>
<p>Since the statistics expressed in hexadecimal only cover 16 values (0
to F), ties would happen quite often. But don’t worry, the game has
another surprise in store for us—one that is also completely absent
from the game manual or any in-game rule explanation. Indeed, it would
be far too simple if <code>9</code> simply meant <code>9</code> or <code>F</code> meant <code>15</code>!</p>
<p>The statistics expressed in hexadecimal actually describe
<strong>intervals</strong>. This means that, for example, if <code>EP12</code> attacks <code>2ME2</code>,
the two <code>E</code>s <strong>represent potentially different concrete values</strong>. It’s
obvious that, for ergonomic reasons (I’m being sarcastic), it is
<strong>impossible</strong> to know the exact values of each card within the game
interface. Here is the <strong>list of possible value intervals for each
level</strong> (using the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)">open
interval</a>
notation where <code>[a, b]</code> means <code>x &gt;= a &amp;&amp; x &lt;= b</code>):</p>

</table></div><p>Since there are always <code>16</code> possible values per statistic, we can

</span></code></pre>
<p>Indeed, some numbers should raise suspicion (for example, <code>32</code>, <code>128</code>,
or even <code>255</code>). In fact, <code>n</code> can be expressed as <code>nF</code>, meaning each
stat point (offensive power, physical defense, and magical defense)
ranges from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. To illustrate my point, the card <code>4P0E</code> will
have:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>offensive power</strong> between <code>64</code> and <code>79</code>;</li>
<li>a <strong>physical defense</strong> between <code>0</code> and <code>15</code>;</li>
<li>a <strong>magical defense</strong> between <code>224</code> and <code>239</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you know this, it’s fairly simple; however, since there is no way
to explicitly know the exact position within the interval, we will,
from a practical standpoint, use the minimum value of the interval to
minimize false positives. Now that we have all the keys to correctly
(though unfortunately only partially) read a card’s statistics — which
I believe is totally overcomplicated and, I repeat, <strong>probably
impossible to deduce just by playing</strong> — we can observe how a battle
unfolds, which obviously adds complexity and randomness. <em>Lovely.</em></p>
<h5 id="battle-progression-even-more-randomness"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#battle-progression-even-more-randomness"></a>Battle Progression: Even More Randomness</h5>
<p>Now that we can read a card’s statistics, combined with understanding
the arrows and card capture mechanics, we should have enough elements
to figure out how to win every match. Although we still need to cover
the <em>combos</em>, which depend on the card positions on the board and will
be detailed in the next section, one might think we have enough
information to win <em>local battles</em>. However, experienced players will
quickly realize that the numbers displayed on the cards during battles
fluctuate and, <em>even worse</em>, scenarios that seem inevitable
<strong>sometimes don’t play out as expected</strong>!</p>
<p>For example, imagine a battle between the cards <code>3P10</code> (attacker) and
<code>2M02</code> (defender). We’re pitting a <strong>physical</strong> <code>3</code> (with power
between <code>48</code> and <code>63</code>) against a <code>0</code> (defense between <code>0</code> and
<code>15</code>). If our interpretation of the stats is correct, there’s no
scenario where the attacking card should lose. And yet, it
happens. Indeed, <strong>there are certain random factors that allow a
weaker card to win a battle</strong>. This is why, during a battle, you’ll
see multiple numbers flashing on the card—reflecting the application
of these random factors.</p>
<p>Let’s revisit our example: <code>3P10</code>, which we’ll call <code>X</code>, attacking
<code>2M02</code>, called <code>Y</code>. As mentioned, we pit <code>3</code> against <code>0</code>. Suppose the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X</code>'s attack value is <code>50</code> (within the range <code>48</code> to <code>63</code>);</li>
<li><code>Y</code>'s defense value is <code>7</code> (within the range <code>0</code> to <code>15</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the initial numbers displayed (and thus the only way to know
the position within the interval), even though, as we’ll see later,
this isn’t reliable for long-term strategy since cards can
<em>evolve</em>. Additionally, in certain situations — like when in a
defensive position — it’s hard to know which statistic is
prioritized. For example, with <code>1P22</code> against a card of type <code>X</code>, how
can you tell if the displayed number targets magical or physical
defense?</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-battle1.png" alt="Initial situation" ></p>
<p>Next, the computer will generate a <strong>random number</strong> between <code>0</code> and
the previously displayed number (so for <code>X</code>, between <code>0</code> and <code>50</code>, and
for <code>Y</code>, between <code>0</code> and <code>7</code>). We’ll call these numbers the
<em>rolls</em>. For this example, let’s assume the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X</code> rolled a <code>46</code>;</li>
<li><code>Y</code> rolled a <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-battle2.png" alt="Next step" ></p>
<p>The rolls are subtracted from the actual values within the
interval. Since each roll is between <code>0</code> and the actual interval
value, the results can never be negative.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X</code> ends up with <code>50 - 46 = 4</code>;</li>
<li><code>Y</code> ends up with <code>7 - 1 = 6</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-battle3.png" alt="Next step" ></p>
<p>And the card with the highest subtraction result wins. Here, against
all expectations, it’s the gray card (which seems much weaker) that
wins (because... logically <code>4 &lt; 6</code>). So, we end up <em>fucked</em> (<em>sorry</em>),
and <strong>our black card is captured</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-battle4.png" alt="Next step" ></p>
<p>We realize that the <strong>rolls</strong> heavily influence the battle’s
outcome. Indeed, <strong>the higher the roll, the greater the risk of
defeat</strong> because the roll is subtracted from the concrete number
within the interval. For example, if card <code>X</code> had rolled a <code>30</code>, the
result would have been <code>20 vs 6</code>, and the black card would have
won. Our example was deliberately pessimistic since we assumed a very
high roll. However, in terms of probability, the black card had about
a <code>~92%</code> chance to win. Still, that leaves roughly an <code>~8%</code> chance of
defeat, which can leave players unfamiliar with Tetra Master's complex
mechanics puzzled and frustrated. Moreover, this rule depends on many
factors difficult to control, like the precise position within the
interval, combined with randomness—all in a poorly explained game with
hard-to-understand statistics. In my view, this randomness adds <strong>a
huge amount of entropy to understanding the rules</strong>, somewhat
justifying the comments of <a href="http://archive.thegia.com/features/990602/staff/s10.html">Drew
Cosner</a>,
cited at the beginning of this article, about the game’s random
nature.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>user feedback</em>, seeing a card display the number <code>40</code> and
still lose to a card showing <code>3</code> can be completely baffling (because
yes, the intermediate numbers — the roll and the subtraction — are not
shown at all).</p>
<h5 id="calculating-the-probability-of-winning-a-duel"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#calculating-the-probability-of-winning-a-duel"></a>Calculating the Probability of Winning a Duel</h5>
<p>Calculating the probability of victory in a battle is fairly easy to
simulate. Here is an approximation which, for our example with <code>X = 50</code> and <code>Y = 7</code>, yields about <code>~92%</code>:</p>

<p>However, this approach relies on two fixed values that are generally
unknown during the game: the exact positions within the intervals. An
(acceptable) solution would be to be <strong>very pessimistic</strong> when
calculating these probabilities by taking the lowest bound of <em>my</em>
card’s interval and the highest bound of the opponent’s:</p>

<p>This gives us a fairly good idea of the probabilities of victory (a
bit pessimistic, but in life, isn’t it better to be cautious).</p>
<p>The funny thing is that once you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to read the compressed representation of the statistics;</li>
<li>the random factors during <em>battles</em>;</li>
<li>the more <em>vague</em> points (the exact number within the interval)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules become <strong>relatively straightforward</strong>, and even though
players can sometimes be caught off guard by the randomness, with all
this information, it is, in my opinion, possible to enjoy and play
Tetra Master more calmly. While I’m jumping ahead a bit, the main
frustration lies in how difficult it is to discover the rules just by
reading the manual or playing the game. I find it quite odd that there
was a deliberate choice to be so vague about how to read the cards and
where randomness comes into play. Without further ado, let’s move on
to combos which, surprisingly, are very predictable and understandable
even without reading the rules (<em>yay</em>)!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, if for some <em>obscure reason</em> you’re interested in the
probability code, to <em>streamline</em> writing this article, I wrote a
small program that easily gives me <strong>the pessimistic success
percentage</strong> of one card attacking another. You can find <a href="https://github.com/xvw/tetra-master-util">the source
code on my Github
page</a>. At the time of
writing this article, the program doesn’t do much, but I might spend
some time in the coming days/weeks/months/years to, why not, build a
<strong>real Tetra Master simulator</strong>. But let’s not dream too much — the
time it took me to write this article might well discourage me from
going further.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="combos"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#combos"></a>Combos</h5>
<p>It must be acknowledged that the manual is quite thorough regarding
the flow of <em>combos</em>. Indeed, this time there’s no randomness, no
implicit rules—the manual explains: &quot;<em>When you win a battle, all cards
targeted by the arrows of the newly won card are also won.</em>&quot; We could
rephrase this as: &quot;<em>In a battle situation, all cards pointed to by the
losing card (i.e., the card just won in the battle) are also
captured.</em>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-basic-3.png" alt="Battle" ></p>
<p>It is important to highlight several points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if the flipped card points to another card <em>during a battle</em>,
the other card is taken without a battle;</li>
<li>Combo effects do not propagate recursively (so if a card is taken
because it is targeted by the loser of a battle, the cards it
targets will not be taken).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Combos</em> can completely turn the tide of a match because it’s possible
to flip up to 8 cards in a single battle. For example, in this
situation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-combo.png" alt="Powerful Combo" ></p>
<p>This situation (artificial, I admit) shows how a single card position
can <strong>completely</strong> change the outcome of a game. Indeed, if the black
card wins (which seems normal given that in the <strong>worst case</strong>, 224
vs. 15, it has a <code>96.44%</code> chance of victory), it will flip its
neighbor, which in turn will flip <strong>without any battle</strong> its 7
neighbors. In the current board setup, this means that regardless of
the next move, the worst-case scenario for the black player would be a
draw.</p>
<p>Combined with the <strong>multiple battles</strong> mechanic, <em>combos</em> introduce
fun micro-strategic choices (and are quite rewarding when
successful). For example, let’s revisit the example presented in the
multiple battles section:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-multiple-battle.png" alt="Multi battle" ></p>
<p>In this situation, we have the opportunity to choose whether to attack
the card above, which has stats <code>EXFF</code>, or to target the card on the
right, which has stats <code>2M12</code>. To recap, the (pessimistic)
probabilities of victory are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>4P23</code> vs <code>EXFF</code> with only a <code>12.70%</code> chance of winning;</li>
<li><code>4P23</code> vs <code>2M12</code> with a <code>75.38%</code> chance of winning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <strong>the card on the left also points to the card above</strong>,
defeating the left card means capturing the top card <em>by
default</em>. This makes it a far more strategic move! Combined with the
blocks we discussed when detailing the game grid, and with some cards
having no arrows (thus blocking combo propagation), there are many
strategies to explore in Tetra Master when focusing on combos. In my
opinion, <strong>this is an excellent mechanic</strong> — well documented and easy
to grasp through play (even if understanding it can be a bit
<em>obfuscated</em> by the difficulty of reading stats and the game's
unpredictable randomness).</p>
<h4 id="pre-conclusion-on-the-rules"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pre-conclusion-on-the-rules"></a>Pre-conclusion on the Rules</h4>
<p>At this point, although there are still some topics to cover, we have
skimmed through the entire set of rules for a match and normally, only
unlucky <em>rolls</em> should make outcomes unpredictable. What we can
<em>pre-conclude</em> from this detailed exploration of the game is that it
actually seems quite <strong>fun</strong>! However, the absence of a comprehensive
guide (in-game or in the manual), combined with random rolls, makes
the game <strong>very frustrating</strong>, as demonstrated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimF-_ESmkU">this
video</a>.</p>
<p>That said, don't worry, Tetra Master still has a few surprises up its
sleeve that directly impact gameplay, increasing randomness and making
rule inference <strong>even more challenging</strong>. While these additions likely
come from good intentions (at least, I hope so), they can end up
generating even more frustration. <em>Stay tuned</em>.</p>
<h3 id="experience-and-card-evolution"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#experience-and-card-evolution"></a>Experience and Card Evolution</h3>
<p>We touched on this a bit earlier, but cards can evolve <strong>within a
defined limit</strong> (specific to each card), and as with many things in
this game, this is <strong>determined in a rather random way</strong>. Indeed,
throughout battles, cards can evolve in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>their attack and defense stats (magical or otherwise) can evolve up
to a certain limit;</li>
<li>the card’s type can change as the adventure progresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>And what’s really fun is that these two types of evolution can happen
completely independently. In other words, <strong>a card’s type can evolve
without it having reached its attack and defense limits</strong>. That’s why
we’ll detail these evolutions in two separate sections, then provide a
list of cards with the maximum stats they can reach.</p>
<h4 id="evolution-of-attack-and-defense"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#evolution-of-attack-and-defense"></a>Evolution of Attack and Defense</h4>
<p>A card has one attack stat and two defense stats (physical defense and
magical defense). Remember, the indices shown on the card are
expressed in <strong>hexadecimal</strong>, ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>F</code> (<code>15</code>). These
indices don’t represent the card’s exact values but rather an
interval. While cards of the same design can have different numbers of
arrows and different concrete stats (their position within the
interval), when acquired, they are assigned attack and defense limits.
For example, the <code>goblin</code> card has, by default, the stats set <code>0P00</code>,
meaning its actual attack and defense values <strong>can range from <code>0</code> to
<code>15</code></strong>. However, through some <em>obscure magic</em> — because, naturally, in
a game so silent about its workings, being explicit about a card’s
maximum stats seems a bit overrated — we know a <code>goblin</code> can have at
most <code>7</code> in attack (still within the <code>0</code> interval), <code>9</code> in physical
defense, and <code>4</code> in magical defense.  Yet, <strong>as long as a card hasn’t
reached these limits, it can continue to evolve</strong>.</p>
<p>Indeed, after each won match, every card used during the game will
have <strong>one point added to either an attack or defense stat, chosen at
random</strong>. This means that after each victory, each stat has a
one-in-three chance of being incremented. The only way to know which
stat was increased is to play that card again in a subsequent match
and check its actual battle score to see which value went up.</p>
<p>An amusing aspect of this random choice of which stat to increase is
that <strong>it completely ignores whether the card has already reached its
stat cap</strong>. So, if our <code>goblin</code> already maxed out at <code>7</code> in attack but
has <code>6</code> in defense and <code>2</code> in magic defense, and luck decides to
increment the attack stat... that point is <strong>simply lost</strong>... <em>meh</em>.</p>
<p>Once again, the <em>obfuscation</em> of this information — and its randomness
— serve to complicate the understanding of the game’s rules! Because
yes, even though the idea of card experience is, in my view, a great
concept that motivates players to keep playing, <strong>without informing
the player about it</strong>, this mechanic essentially makes understanding
the stats (and the numbers shown on the card during battles) <strong>even
harder to figure out</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="evolution-of-card-types"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#evolution-of-card-types"></a>Evolution of Card Types</h4>
<p>In addition to being able to upgrade a card’s attack and defense
stats, cards can also <strong>change type</strong>. Any card of type <code>P</code> or <code>M</code> can
evolve into type <code>X</code>, and any card of type <code>X</code> can evolve into type
<code>A</code>. These evolutions follow this hierarchy, which makes perfect sense
since type <code>X</code> is objectively superior to types <code>M</code> or <code>P</code>, while
still being inferior to type <code>A</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-type-lattice.png" alt="Type Evolution Lattice" ></p>
<p>Unlike the previous evolutions, which depend on winning an entire
game, cards can change type <strong>each time they win a battle</strong> (whether
they are on the offensive or defensive side). Specifically, when a
card <strong>wins a battle</strong>, a <code>P</code> or <code>M</code> type card has a <code>1</code> in <code>32</code>
chance to evolve into an <code>X</code> card, and an <code>X</code> card has a <code>1</code> in <code>256</code>
chance to evolve into an <code>A</code> card.</p>
<p>Even though the chances of evolution (of card type) are <em>relatively
low</em>, unlike the increases to offensive or defensive points, type
changes are much easier to track (since, logically, the type is
clearly displayed on the card). When we get to the final section of
this article — <strong>the collector’s level</strong> — we’ll see that reaching
level <code>A</code> with all cards is necessary, which makes it all the more
important to clarify the method for getting a card to reach that
level.</p>
<h4 id="card-list"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#card-list"></a>Card List</h4>
<p>Since the maximum stats of the cards are <strong>of course</strong> not provided
anywhere, here’s a list of the 100 cards available in the game, which
I found
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190927185010/http://www.espritduo.com/random/ff9_card_data.txt">here</a>. Given
that it’s been over 20 years, and I doubt these max stats will ever
change, I’m taking the liberty of reproducing the list here, in the
spirit of <em>vendorisation</em> (I couldn’t find a better translation —
apologies). Here’s how the table is structured:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Name</code>: the English name of the card</li>
<li><code>Type</code>: its original type (<code>P</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>X</code>, or <code>A</code>)</li>
<li><code>Atk</code>: the maximum number of <em>actual</em> attack points the card can reach</li>
<li><code>Def</code>: the maximum number of <em>actual</em> physical defense points</li>
<li><code>MDef</code>: the maximum number of <em>actual</em> magical defense points</li>
<li><code>MStats</code>: the highest <em>displayable</em> stat on the card (they’re all
shown as type <code>A</code>, since every card can eventually reach that tier)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you know how to level up a card’s stats and upgrade its type,
it’s time to dive into the final layer of confusion this game has to
offer... <strong>the Collector Level</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="collector-level"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#collector-level"></a>Collector Level</h3>
<p>The rules of the game and the logic behind card evolution no longer
hold any secrets for us—so it’s time to tackle the final mystery: the
infamous <em>Collector Level</em>. When opening the card menu (from the <em>main
menu</em>), you can view your entire card collection and see several
statistics displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of games won</li>
<li>the number of games lost</li>
<li>the number of draws</li>
<li>the <code>level</code>, shown in <code>p</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first three pieces of information shouldn’t (in principle) require
any clarification. The game keeps track of played matches and provides
a summary through this menu. However, what really draws our attention
is the <strong>level</strong>. Indeed, by observing how this level evolves over
time, like many elements of Tetra Master, it’s very difficult to
understand how this counter changes (once again, we’re faced with a
rather <em>convoluted</em> rule).</p>
<p>Even more amusingly, you can quickly realize that the three summary
elements (wins, losses, and draws) don’t actually affect this
score. Indeed, there are several situations where <strong>the outcome of a
match won’t change the level</strong>. And yes, as is often the case with
this game, why settle for something simple and deducible when you can
choose a metric that’s completely <em>all over the place</em>? To put it
simply, the level <strong>is determined by the cards you own</strong>, according to
a <em>very specific</em> mechanic that we’ll now detail without further ado.</p>
<h4 id="the-different-levels"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-different-levels"></a>The Different Levels</h4>
<p>Before explaining how to calculate points based on the cards you own,
here is the list of different levels you can reach in the
game. Remember, your card level <strong>has no impact on the actual
gameplay</strong>.</p>

</table></div><p>Funny to have so many progression steps for a point system that's so
hard to figure out, isn’t it? Once again, we can grumble about the
game’s excess of implicit rules, where every design choice seems made
to <em>confuse the player</em>. As we’ll see in the upcoming sections, the
points calculation is far from trivial!</p>
<h4 id="on-the-distinction-between-cards"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#on-the-distinction-between-cards"></a>On the distinction between cards</h4>
<p>Before diving into the <em>correlation</em> between the cards you own and the
points they yield, it’s important to clarify some terminology. Here
are the key elements that <strong>define</strong> a card for the purpose of point
calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>its <strong>figure</strong>, for example <code>Goblin</code> or <code>Fat Chocobo</code>;</li>
<li>its <strong>arrow pattern</strong>;</li>
<li>its <strong>type</strong> (<code>X</code> or <code>A</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Cards of type <code>P</code> or <code>M</code> do not provide any bonus points, and the card
statistics (including their evolution) do not affect the point
calculation.</p>
<p>So when we talk about a <strong>unique card</strong>, we mean a card with a
specific figure that you own only once. When we talk about an
<strong>additional card</strong>, we mean a card with a figure that you own
multiple times.</p>
<h4 id="points-awarded-per-card"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#points-awarded-per-card"></a>Points awarded per card</h4>
<p>Points are calculated based on the cards you own and how their arrows
are arranged (<em>ouch</em>). Schematically, we can define the axes that earn
points as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the <strong>diversity of cards</strong> you own. Simply put, you can only hold
<code>100</code> cards at once, and there are exactly <code>100</code> card figures (like
<em>Goblin</em>). So, to maximize points, you need to have only different
figures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <strong>diversity of arrow patterns</strong> on the cards you own. To
maximize points, each card <strong>should have a unique arrow pattern</strong>
(<em>no, this is not a joke</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <strong>power level of the cards</strong> you own. Cards marked <code>X</code> and <code>A</code>
give bonus points, so to maximize points, all cards should be level
<code>A</code> (which gives the highest points).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how a card can earn points — these attributes are cumulative
(except, of course, for the card type, because logically, a card can’t
be both <code>X</code> and <code>A</code> at the same time):</p>
<div role="region"><table>
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Reward</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unique card?</td>
<td>+10 points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unique arrow pattern?</td>
<td>+5 points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If it’s an <code>X</code> card?</td>
<td>+1 point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If it’s an <code>A</code> card?</td>
<td>+2 points</td>
</tr>
</table></div><h5 id="note-on-pattern-permutations"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#note-on-pattern-permutations"></a>Note on Pattern Permutations</h5>
<p>A card can have <strong>between <code>0</code> and <code>8</code> arrows</strong>. In other words, for
each of the <code>8</code> slots, there may or may not be an arrow, which
corresponds to <code>256</code> possible permutations. We can easily verify this
by representing each slot as a boolean—<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. If all slots are
filled, we get a sequence of eight <code>1</code>: <code>11111111</code>, which is the
binary representation of <code>255</code> (since binary <code>11111111</code> equals decimal
<code>255</code>). So actually, there are <code>256</code> possible combinations from <code>0</code>
(no arrows) to <code>255</code> (all arrows).</p>
<p>We can even describe, <strong>by number of arrows</strong>, the number of possible
combinations with this formula:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tetra-permut.png" alt="Permutation formula" ></p>
<p>This gives us the list of possible combinations for each number of
arrows, showing that we don’t have to rely on <em>weak patterns</em> to reach
the highest level. In fact, there are <code>163</code> combinations including
<strong>at least <code>4</code> arrows</strong>:</p>

</table></div><p>While to reach the maximum, you need <strong>all the cards</strong> and they <strong>must
all be level <code>A</code></strong>, you only have to worry about about <code>~39%</code> (<code>100</code>
out of <code>256</code>) of the different arrow patterns. <em>Nice</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-cherry-on-top"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-cherry-on-top"></a>The cherry on top</h4>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you might have noticed something. We
said each card could <strong>earn a maximum of <code>17</code> points</strong>, and there are
<code>100</code> cards, so you’d expect a total of <code>1700</code> points. But the level
table stops at <code>1698</code>. So, what happens if you actually reach <code>1700</code>?
You might expect a big surprise, like a rare item or a congratulatory
NPC. Well, the answer comes from <strong>ik141</strong> (as reported in the <em>sombre
document</em>; unfortunately, I couldn’t find the original message), who
took the time to discover the <strong>maximum achievable level</strong> in Tetra
Master:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what happens at <code>1700</code>, you ask? Well, under your collector
pts. where <code>Master</code> was written it now says, superimposed over
everything, '<code>Would you like to discard?</code>'. So, after a hundred
hours of playing this game I am rewarded with a <em>F***ING
GLITCH</em>!!!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m delighted to end this long dive into the rules of Tetra Master on
such a cheerful note. You’re not dreaming — the guide where this
testimony of frustration was recorded is roughly contemporaneous with
the game’s release. <strong>ik141</strong>’s feat is truly impressive because:</p>
<ul>
<li>he didn’t have the guide I used to understand the rules;</li>
<li>the state of emulation back then wasn’t nearly as advanced as it is
today. So, we can reasonably assume (though it might just be
speculation) that this card prodigy tried to complete the game,
including the Tetra Master quest... <em>the old-fashioned way</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-conclude-finally"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#to-conclude-finally"></a>To conclude, finally</h2>
<p><em>A chapter closes.</em> I discovered FFIX over 20 years ago, and every
time I tried, Tetra Master always left a bitter taste in my
throat. After two attempts (one in 2012 via <em>emulation</em> and another in
2020 on Nintendo Switch) to understand the rules of the <em>game within
the game</em>, I gave up and turned to the internet for help. It was a
very entertaining investigation that made me question the <strong>true
quality of the game</strong>. Diving into the rules of Tetra Master altered
the conclusion I thought I had when I started writing this
article. Having been a <strong>huge fan</strong> of the ninth installment of this
saga that marked me so deeply, my frustration and bitterness towards
Tetra Master grew. When I first began researching, I was furious about
what I read and convinced my conclusion would be scathing. However,
probably because I developed a sort of <em>Stockholm syndrome</em>, since
learning the rules, I’ve developed a morbid fondness for Tetra
Master. <strong>I’m very happy to have finally learned how to play it.</strong></p>
<p>To wrap up this article (which took me over 15 days to write, though I
took plenty of breaks), I’ll try to give a balanced opinion on the
game.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-we-take-away-from-this"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-can-we-take-away-from-this"></a>What can we take away from this?</h3>
<p>Whether on <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> or
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, opinions are mixed. Some hate Tetra
Master, others love it. However, without bad faith, the vast majority
of people sharing their views agree on one thing: the game is too
complicated and its rules are <strong>impossible to deduce</strong>. As for me, now
that I believe I’ve understood all the game’s rules, I find it hard to
consider it a bad game. It’s packed with clever ideas. For example,
calculating the <strong>collector level</strong> based on the cards themselves
rather than a simple win/loss ratio allows the score to adjust as you
progress, making almost no defeat <em>too punishing</em>.</p>
<p>Another fairly common criticism of the game, as seen in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/vuq3wc/oh_my_god_tetra_master_is_absolutely_awful/">Reddit

is the presence of randomness. At first, I was pretty on board with
the idea of <em>bashing randomness</em>. However, with a bit of hindsight,
I’ve come to realize that <strong>randomness is present in many popular card
games</strong>. For example, when a game involves a <em>draw pile</em> or the fact
that you don’t know your opponent’s hand—and some games <strong>rely
entirely on randomness</strong> (the very popular card game <em>War</em>, for
instance).</p>
<p>For my part, <strong>what I truly criticize</strong> about the game is <strong>the
impossibility of deducing its rules</strong> and <strong>the very limited user
feedback</strong>. I firmly believe that if the game had been more
explicit—whether <em>in-game</em> or in its manual—about its rules (and
various mechanics), and if the real statistics of the cards were
accessible from a menu (and explained, of course), the reception of
the game wouldn’t have been so poor. Besides, I’m quite curious about
how the presentation (and reception) of the Tetra Master concept went
down at Squaresoft.</p>
<p>To conclude, I believe some rules could be simplified, and the game
should provide more information and explanations. However, contrary to
all expectations, once you know the rules, the game is much more
enjoyable than you might imagine. And if you’ve had the courage to
make it this far in the article, I’d be curious to hear your feedback
on the game experience once you understand the rules!</p>

<p>It’s quite fun to develop an interest in a game by <em>laying out its
rules because they were originally incomprehensible</em>. So, it’s
possible I won’t stop here. In fact, writing this article has given me
the desire — if time allows — to create a <strong>free implementation</strong> of
the game (though it’s likely this project will never see the light of
day, <em>due to lack of time and motivation</em>).</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgments"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#acknowledgments"></a>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>The first thank you I want to give goes to <strong>Trifthen</strong> — I have no
idea who he is, but without <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221226113714/https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197338-final-fantasy-ix/faqs/9671">his
guide</a>,
which has become a go-to reference online for understanding Tetra
Master’s rules, I would never have been able to write my own (which is
admittedly more naive). The precision and thoroughness of their work
sometimes made me want to give up writing this article, thinking I had
nothing to add to their document. But hey, my personal site has been
pretty dormant, so a bit of content can’t hurt!</p>
<p>Next, to cross-reference the information from <strong>Trifthen</strong>’s guide, I
want to give a special thanks to
<a href="https://xhtmlboi.github.io"><strong>Antoine</strong></a> for granting me access to
resources I unfortunately can’t share in this article, as well as to
all the <a href="http://www.epsxe.com/">ePSXe maintainers</a> who made it
possible for me to <em>navigate internal game data</em>.</p>
<p>My renewed interest in video games — especially JRPGs — was greatly
sparked by <a href="https://github.com/BastienDuplessier"><strong>Bastien</strong></a>, who
kindly gifted me in August the excellent book <a href="https://www.bitmapbooks.com/products/a-guide-to-japanese-role-playing-games"><em>A Guide to Japanese
Role-Playing
Games</em></a>. Reading
its opening pages instantly inspired me to <em>try making an RPG again</em> —
this time giving myself more time than I did for creating <a href="https://xvw.itch.io/almost-heroic"><em>Almost
Heroic</em></a>.</p>
<p>I also warmly thank <strong>Lorie</strong>, who endured my <em>strange obsession</em> one
entire evening as I shared a mix of wonder and dread facing the
cathedral of complexity that the Tetra Master rules seemed to be. Her
attentive listening and questions helped clarify certain points (and
some terminological choices), and she kindly offered to proofread,
improving my disastrous spelling and awkward phrasing. It’s truly
valuable and delightful to have people around with a natural
<em>acquaintance</em> for written expression and a love for beautiful
sentences.</p>
<p>After publishing this article, I received a collection of reviews and
feedback from <a href="https://hakimba.github.io/oxywa/"><strong>Hakim</strong></a>,
<a href="https://www.abitus.net/"><strong>Matthieu</strong></a>, the unforgettable
<a href="https://github.com/fenntasy"><strong>Fenn</strong></a>, as well as from <strong>Maël</strong> —
thank you all!</p>
<p>To conclude, I want to thank all the people who have praised or
criticized the game across the various platforms offered by the World
Wide Web, as well as the potential readers who managed to digest this
very long article on such an outdated topic!</p>
<h3 id="the-final-word"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-final-word"></a>The Final Word</h3>
<p>More than twenty years later, a chapter closes. It’s hard to see
myself as an adult without having understood the rules of Tetra
Master. Now it’s done! I can finally focus on less interesting and
less formative projects! Jokes aside, I really enjoyed this work of
archaeology, writing (and a bit of implementation). It was a lot of
fun, and I’ll try to be more consistent with my writing, maybe
continuing to describe game mechanics! Thanks again for reading, and
<em>enjoy the heatwave</em>!</p>
